  "description": "Elegant arrangements of cookies or cakes, lavish and overflowing arrays of fruits, or the remnants of a gluttonous feast\u2014depictions of food in art certainly convey a passion for culinary delights. Yet, still-life paintings of edibles also speak volumes about their cultural context. American artists have used food to both celebrate and critique their developing society; express ideas relating to politics, race, class, gender, and commerce; and investigate American identity. This exhibition brings together over 100 paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts from the 18th through the 20th century, along with a selection of period cookbooks, menus, trade cards, and posters, to explore the art and culture of food and examine the many meanings and interpretations of eating in America. \n\nFrom the earliest years of the United States, American artists such as Raphaelle Peale used still-life painting to express cultural, political, and social values, elevating the genre to a significant aesthetic language. In antebellum America, depictions of food highlighted abundance and increasing wealth. Elegant decanters of wine and spirits in still-life paintings by John F. Francis reflect the prevalence of drinking and the mid-century debates over temperance. During the Gilded Age, despite the implications of the term, American artists moved away from excess and eschewed high Victorian opulence in favor of painting the simple meal. Many artists, such as William Harnett or De Scott Evans, also used food pictures to serve up biting political commentary that addressed the social and economic changes of the 1880s and 1890s. \n\nIn the 20th century new ways of eating and socializing began to change depictions of food in art. Restaurant dining\u2014still novel in the United States in the late 19th century\u2014became a common subject in the works of William Glackens, John Sloan, and others. Caf\u00e9 and cocktail culture became increasingly important, described in the work of Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy, even as Prohibition banned the consumption of alcohol. \n\nFinally, during the 1950s and 1960s, Pop artists Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg addressed the ways in which mass production and consumption dramatically altered the American experience of food. Hamburgers, fries, and cakes were painted as objects of mass-produced comestibles without human referent. Artists employed new means to express their distance from the tangible reality of food, the visual power of advertising, the standardization of American meals from factory-produced products, and the gluttony of American appetites. \n\nToday as professional and home chefs increasingly turn toward local, organic food and American society ponders its history as a fast-food nation, this exhibition on the historical art of eating allows viewers to look at depictions of American food and culture with new meaning and fresh eyes.",

  "title": "Abelardo Morell: The Universe Next Door",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Over the course of the past 25 years, Cuban-born American artist Abelardo Morell has become internationally renowned for works that employ the language of photography to explore visual surprise and wonder. This exhibition of over 100 works made from 1986 to the present is the first retrospective of Morell\u2019s photographs in 15 years. Showing a range of works and series\u2014including many newer color photographs never exhibited before\u2014the exhibition reveals how this persistently creative artist has returned to a photographic vocabulary as a source of great inspiration.\n\nMorell came with his family to the United States as a teenager in 1962. He received a scholarship to attend Bowdoin College in Maine, where he first took a photography course; he later completed an MFA in photography at Yale University, looking to street photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Frank as models. After the birth of his son in 1986, he began making large-format pictures around his home, examining common household objects with childlike curiosity. As a professor at Massachusetts College of Art and Design, he experimented with optics in his teaching and initiated a series in which he turned an entire room into a camera obscura, photographing the projection of the outside world juxtaposed onto the surfaces of the room\u2019s interior.\n\nThese twin poles\u2014examining objects and images with fresh vision and exploring simple optics in myriad forms\u2014have been consistent orientation points for the many series that have since followed. Morell has turned his camera on conveyors of cultural meaning such as books, maps, money, and museums in extensive series that explore the perception of images. He has experimented with techniques as varied as photograms, still-life tableaux, stop-motion studies, and most recently the tent camera\u2014a kind of portable camera obscura that throws the image of a landscape upon the ground\u2019s surface. Now, after decades of working exclusively in black and white, he has begun to embrace color, both returning to old themes and series to view them in a new spectrum and pioneering new ways to understand optical effects, nature, and picture making. Showcasing his ever-inventive practice, this retrospective traces Morell\u2019s innovative career as he continues to mine the essential strangeness and complexity of images.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Rigorously purged of descriptive detail and sharply composed, the works Matisse produced between late 1913 and 1917 are among his most demanding, experimental, and enigmatic. While these works have typically been seen as unrelated responses to the influences of Cubism and World War I, this exhibition illustrates the deep connections between them and their critical role in an ambitious, cohesive project of developing what Matisse called \u201cthe methods of modern construction\u201d\u2014a process in which the act of creation itself was the main focus.\nUnlike his earlier art, which was characterized by rich color and arabesque line, these new paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings are often rigorously abstracted, heavily reworked, and dominated by black and gray. Canvases typically show a multitude of paint layers and a nearly sculptural approach to scraping and incising; sculptures display a remarkable emphasis on geometry and structure; prints reflect and reinform the incising and scraping that the artist devised for his paintings; and drawings are frequently composed of a network of erasures and stumping, and elegant, spare line.\nMatisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917 explores how Matisse developed his own version of Modernism, one work after the next, during the most ambitious, unbridled, and radically inventive period of his long career.",

  "title": "When the Greeks Ruled: Egypt After Alexander the Great",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "When Alexander the Great seized Egypt on his mission to conquer the Persian Empire in 332 B.C., he was one in a long line of Greeks who were dazzled by Egypt and its ancient culture. The legendary Greek historian Herodotus had remarked in the fifth century B.C., \u201cthis country has more marvels and monuments that defy description than any other,\u201d and indeed those \u201cmarvels and monuments\u201d had been drawing Greeks to Egypt for centuries\u2014as tourists, traders, diplomats, and soldiers. Despite this cultural contact, the art and architecture of the Egyptian kingdom had retained its distinct style, uninfluenced by its frequent visitors. In fact, Egypt\u2019s unique art forms had persisted for more than 3,000 years! \n\nWhen Ptolemy, one of Alexander\u2019s generals, came to rule Egypt, he found it wise to adapt to the older culture. He installed himself as \u201cpharaoh,\u201d built a new capital at Alexandria, and united the two major gods of each nation to form a new universal deity, Zeus Amon. The era of Ptolemy\u2019s dynasty is known as the Ptolemaic Period, acknowledging the 300-year Greek rule that began with Alexander the Great and ended with the suicide of Queen Cleopatra in 30 B.C. It was an age of profound curiosity and rich experimentation, as the Greeks, and later the Romans, met an established culture far older than their own and exchanged artistic, social, and religious ideas with the ancient civilization. \n\nThis exhibition explores this confluence of cultures through over 75 artworks. Gilded mummy masks, luxury glass, magical amulets, and portraits in stone and precious metals, demonstrate the integration of foreign styles while also paying tribute to the enduring legacy of ancient Egypt\u2019s distinctive visual culture.",

  "title": "DEAD TIME",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "At the center of Cally Spooner\u2019s DEAD TIME is a 63-page score of the same title, which consists of drawings, photos, captions of her recent work, and fan mail, both borrowed and self-authored. The score is hosted on the front of a 49-foot-long wall, whose smooth surface is typical of a contemporary art gallery. Yet the rear of the wall is raw and unfinished, like a vacant backstage.\n \nEach day this wall becomes the scenography for a live performance of the score, enacted by living, prerecorded, and inanimate elements. These include a dancer who attempts to repair her body and prolong time; an actor who strives for anatomical perfection only to stagnate; and a narrator who ruminates on failing nervous systems, financial centers, and a celebrity under attack because of #MeToo shame. Disembodied voices call out \u201cMother\u201d repeatedly, while Ivanka Trump narrates her capacity to \u201carchitect\u201d her life, work, and children. Alongside, there is the sound of the dancer, sniffling and gasping, as she\u2019s suffering from a head cold. A cellist plays to the tune of shame, repeating a Netflix theme song, and a stainless-steel drinking fountain runs perpetually. Disconnected from a public water line and recirculating its own supply of overly chlorinated, poisonous water, the fountain is cleaning itself to death. Each of these elements, drawn out from the score, occurs in the gallery according to its own duration, repertoire, and speed. Once a day, for an hour, all the elements collide.\n \nAt once an installation, an instruction, and a live performance, DEAD TIME takes its name from the cinematic technique temps morts (lit. \u201cdead time\u201d), in which the camera is left running to film unplanned and unscripted occurrences. These seemingly \u201cdead\u201d moments may, in fact, be brimming with life. Living and nonliving elements overlap, dancers collapse into inertia, repetitive and monotonous sounds penetrate the space, overlooked details become legible, scenes are inactive and empty, yet captivating. Here, hidden and disavowed temporalities arrive, providing an alternative to how neoliberalism and corporate capitalism aim to manage, monetize, and control all life, which DEAD TIME as a whole reflects on, stages, and resists.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre\nJuly 16\u2013October 10, 2005\nRegenstein Hall\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864\u20131901), one of the most popular and important painters of late-19th-century Paris, has not been the subject of a major exhibition since the large retrospective presented in London and Paris in 1991 and 1992. The National Gallery of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago have collaborated to organize Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre, an exhibition that places the artist's work at the peak of his career between 1888 and 1896 in conjunction with the work of other artists of the period. Toulouse-Lautrec and his contemporaries produced images that evocatively record the social geography of Montmartre, Paris' center of licit and illicit entertainment. Taking Montmartre as a state of mind as well as an environment, the exhibition reevaluates the decadent worldview of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris. The focus is on several Montmartre establishments, including dance halls, the circus, and maisons closes (a French euphemism for brothels), and the installation integrates major avant-garde paintings, topographical canvases, and posters and caricatures of stars such as Aristide Bruant and Lo\u00efe Fuller.\n\nThe aim of the exhibition is to place Toulouse-Lautrec in a wider cultural context and to include for comparison and contrast a selection of works by his contemporaries\u2014including painters, printmakers, and poster artists\u2014to evoke the life and art of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Montmartre. This supporting cast includes such famous names as Degas, Van Gogh, and Picasso, but also less well-known artists such as Anquetin, Steinlen, and Casas, who also captured the spirit of the age. The inclusion of these works adds a new dimension to our understanding of Toulouse-Lautrec and his time.\n\n\nCATALOGUE\nThe exhibition catalogue, Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre, is available in the Museum Shop. Hardcover, $60; softcover, $40. Click here for more information.\n\n\nORGANIZERS\nThis exhibition was organized by the Art Institute of Chicago and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\n\nCURATORS\nGuest curator for Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre is professor Richard Thomson, University of Edinburgh, a leading scholar of Toulouse-Lautrec and fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris and curator of the 1991\u201392 retrospective. Organizing curator for the Washington D.C. venue is Philip Conisbee, senior curator of European paintings at the National Gallery of Art. In Chicago, organizing curators are Douglas Druick, Searle Curator of European Painting and Prince Trust Curator of Prints and Drawings, and Gloria Groom, David and Mary Winton Green Curator of Medieval through Modern European Painting and Modern European Sculpture, and Mary Weaver Chapin, former Mellon Curatorial Fellow.\n\n\nOTHER VENUES\nToulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre was presented at the National Gallery of Art from March 20 to June 12, 2005, and is on view at the Art Institute of Chicago from July 16 to October 10, 2005.\n\n\nSPONSORS\nThe Sara Lee Foundation is the exclusive corporate sponsor of Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Emerging from decades of civil war and struggles to defend its own territory, France was on the move in the years around 1500, led first by Charles VIII and then by his cousin Louis XII, each king in turn marrying Anne, the spirited young duchess of Brittany. Through an extraordinary range of rare and precious objects, this exhibition tells the story of art in this dynamic period\u2014an exuberant mixture of spiritual and secular work, the union of traditional late Gothic form and a new antique vocabulary, and the combination of the many symbols of the French monarchy with the latest trends imported from Milan, Genoa, and Naples, cities that French forces occupied in this period. A rich and varied panorama of this transitional moment is illustrated through tapestries, stained glass, goldsmithwork, monumental sculpture, painted portraits and altarpieces, and intimate illuminated manuscripts. The diverse offerings include a witty stained-glass roundel designed by court painter Jean Fouquet depicting two maidens holding the initials of Laurens Girard for the home of this courtier, one of the king's treasurers. The luminous Nativity by Jean Hey, known as the Master of Moulins, is also on display, a commission from Cardinal Jean Rolin, bishop of Autun in Burgundy, as an epitaph near his grave. The cardinal's favorite lapdog accompanies him as he kneels in perpetual prayer before the vulnerable, newborn Christ Child. And the poetic The Madonna of the Yarnwinder by Leonardo da Vinci and his assistants exemplifies how the French kings and leading courtiers sought from Italy marble, sculptors, and paintings in the latest fashion to decorate their castles and monuments.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium from Greek Collections presents 63 superb artworks from the early Christian and Byzantine eras in the Mary and Michael Jaharis Galleries of Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Art. Originally exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the exhibition represents major artistic holdings from Greece\u2014many of which have never been exhibited outside that country\u2014consisting of shimmering mosaics, architectural fragments, manuscripts, luxury glass, silver, personal adornments, liturgical textiles, and painted icons. The Art Institute\u2019s display offers a selection of exceptional works from the original exhibition, including the debut of the 14th-century Icon of Saint Prokopios.\n\nFor over 1,000 years, Greece was part of the vast Byzantine Empire, established in 330 A.D. by the emperor Constantine, who moved the capital of the Roman Empire eastwards to a small town named Byzantium in modern-day Turkey. Renamed and transformed into Constantinople, Byzantium would later lend its name to an empire of splendor and power that endured for more than a millennium. Greek replaced Latin as the language of the empire, and Greece itself was home to important centers of theology, scholarship, and artistic production. Heaven and Earth explores the rich legacy of the Byzantine Empire through five main themes: the transition from the Classical to the Byzantine world, spiritual life, intellectual life, the pleasures of life, and crosscurrents between East and West during the final days of the empire in the 15th century.",

  "title": "The \u201cGates of Paradise\u201d: Lorenzo Ghiberti's Renaissance Masterpiece",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In 1425 Lorenzo Ghiberti was commissioned to design a pair of bronze doors for Florence's Baptistery. He labored on the task for 27 years, fashioning a masterpiece that Michelangelo called \"truly worthy to be the Gates of Paradise\" for its remarkable beauty and grandeur. For the past 25 years, Ghiberti's gates have undergone extensive conservation, which is now nearing completion. To celebrate the conclusion of this arduous project, three relief panels from the Gates of Paradise and sections of the doors' frieze have traveled to North America. This exhibition affords viewers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe Ghiberti's work up close before the individual elements are reintegrated with the rest of the doorframe and put on permanent display in a hermetically sealed room in the museum of the Florence Cathedral (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo), never to travel again.\n\nDepicting the stories of Adam and Eve, Jacob and Esau, and David and Goliath, the panels offer viewers a coherent vision of Ghiberti's artistic genius and the range of perspectival solutions he invented for his narrative panels. This exhibition also reveals the complex nature of the conservation process through the juxtaposition of two sections of the frieze and two decorative heads: one version of each has been resplendently cleaned; the other is still disfigured by damaging surface deposits. A video documents the conservation methods used, including cutting-edge laser technology, which enables the surface dirt to be cleaned in a non-invasive manner.\n\nSculptor, painter, draftsman, architectural consultant, stained-glass designer, entrepreneur, author of a treatise on the arts, and the first artist to write an autobiography, Ghiberti could honestly declare in his Commentaries that \"few things of importance were made in our city that were not designed or devised by my hand.\" The masterpieces in this exhibition, while representing only a small portion of his works, confirm that Ghiberti had good reason to boast.",

  "title": "The City Lost and Found: Capturing New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, 1960-1980",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The American city of the 1960s and 1970s experienced seismic physical changes and social transformations, from urban decay and political protests to massive highways that threatened vibrant neighborhoods. Nowhere was this sense of crisis more evident than in the country\u2019s three largest cities: New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Yet in this climate of uncertainty and upheaval, the streets and neighborhoods of these cities offered places where a host of different actors\u2014photographers, artists, filmmakers, planners, and activists\u2014could transform these conditions of crisis into opportunities for civic discourse and creative expression.\n\nThe City Lost and Found is the first exhibition to explore this seminal period through the emergence of new photographic and cinematic practices that reached from the art world to the pages of Life magazine. Instead of aerial views and sweeping panoramas, photographers and filmmakers turned to in-depth studies of streets, pedestrian life, neighborhoods, and seminal urban events, like Bruce Davidson\u2019s two-year study of a single block in Harlem, East 100th Street (1966\u201368). These new forms of photography offered the public a complex image of urban life and experience while also allowing architects, planners, and journalists to imagine and propose new futures for American cities.\n\nDrawn from the Art Institute\u2019s holdings, as well as from more than 30 collections across the United States, this exhibition brings together a large range of media, from slideshows and planning documents to photo collage and artist books. The City Lost and Found showcases important bodies of work by renowned photographers and photojournalists such as Thomas Struth, Martha Rosler, and Barton Silverman, along with artists known for their profound connections to place, such as Romare Bearden in New York and ASCO in Los Angeles. In addition, projects like artist Allan Kaprow\u2019s Chicago happening, Moving, and architect Shadrach Wood\u2019s hybrid plan for SoHo demonstrate how photography and film were used in unconventional ways to make critical statements about the stakes of urban change. Blurring traditional boundaries between artists, activists, planners, and journalists, The City Lost and Found offers an unprecedented opportunity to experience the deep interconnections between art practices and the political, social, and geographic realities of American cities in the 1960s and 1970s.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "This show, which included ninety original paintings, was the first major travelling exhibition of the original, large-scale watercolors John James Audubon painted for The Birds of America. After beginning with static depictions of birds in profile, in the style of eighteenth-century naturalists, Audubon began to depict birds in motion and experiment with a variety of media, including watercolor, gouache, and oil. In his mature works, he often combined many techniques and media for a single image: graphite strokes on wings to lend iridescence or blended pastel that suggested the soft texture of feathers. The exhibition also examined the engraving and hand coloring undertaken by Robert Havell, Jr. and his assistants to turn Audubon\u2019s immense watercolors (life-sized, even for large birds) into prints. The exhibition traced this process through a sequence showing an engraved copperplate, uncolored and unfinished prints, and a complete bound volume of the \u201cDouble Elephant\u201d folio of The Birds of America, so named for its exceptional size. In addition to the Art Institute of Chicago, this exhibition was on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Memphis Beooks Museum of Art, the New-York Historical Society, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.",

  "description": "The following images are accompanied by excerpts of letters written by Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh between 1887 and 1889. The two artists wrote often to one another, friends, and relatives. Van Gogh's most frequent correspondent was his brother Theo, an art dealer in Paris in the late 1880s. The quotations reveal that both men were avid chroniclers of the subjects they painted: peasants, townspeople, landscapes, and houses. The painters' candid remarks about their own canvases, most of which had either just been completed or were still in progress, offer unique perspectives on the Arles period. They also refer to a number of works painted before and after the artists' time togethe",
  "short_description": "Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh, celebrated today for their profound impact on the history of modern painting, were both relative latecomers to art. By the time they met in the autumn of 1887, both men were well into their thirties (Gauguin 39, van Gogh 34), and each had several failed careers behind him.",

  "title": "Josef Koudelka: Nationality Doubtful",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Czech-born French artist Josef Koudelka belongs in the firmament of classic photographers working today. Honored with the French Prix Nadar (1978), the Hasselblad Prize (1992), and the International Center of Photography Infinity Award (2004), Koudelka is also a leading member of the world-renowned photo agency Magnum. This exhibition, his first retrospective in the United States since 1988, is also the first museum show ever to emphasize his original vintage prints, period books, magazines, and significant unpublished materials.\n\nKoudelka became famous in anonymity through the worldwide publication of his daring photographs of the Soviet-led invasion of Prague in August 1968. Just 30 years old at the time, Koudelka had already worked for a decade, principally on Gypsies, for which he visited Roma populations for weeks at a time in his home country and later abroad over the course of years. This ambitious series beautifully combines a sense of modern history with timeless humanism.\n\nChoosing exile to avoid reprisals for his Invasion photographs, Koudelka traveled throughout Europe during the 1970s and 1980s, camping at village festivals from spring through fall and then printing in wintertime. His photographs of those decades became the series Exiles. Since the late 1980s Koudelka has made panoramic landscape photographs in areas massively shaped by industry, territorial conflict, or\u2014in the case of the Mediterranean rim\u2014the persistence of Classical civilization.\n\nTracing this long and impressive career, this exhibition draws on Koudelka\u2019s extensive holdings of his own work and on recent major acquisitions by the Art Institute, including the complete surviving contents of the debut presentation of Gypsies in 1967 (22 photographs), as well as ten Invasion images printed by the photographer just weeks after the event. Also on display are early experimental and theater photographs and some of the photographer\u2019s beautifully produced books\u2014which stretch dozens of feet when unfolded. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition, which after its debut at the Art Institute travels to the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, and Fundaci\u00f3n MAPFRE, Madrid.",

  "title": "H\u00e9lio Oiticica: To Organize Delirium",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "H\u00e9lio Oiticica (1937\u201380) is arguably the most influential Latin American artist of the post\u2013World War II period and is recognized for his significant contributions to the development of contemporary art. A relentless innovator always pushing the traditional boundaries of art, Oiticica moved rapidly and radically from early works influenced by European modernism to large-scale installations that were meant to be physically experienced and often to critique political and social issues. This exhibition offers the first retrospective in the United States of the Brazilian artist\u2019s groundbreaking and influential achievements.\n\nDemonstrating the great breadth of the artist\u2019s work, the exhibition begins with the adventurously elegant works on paper from early in Oiticica\u2019s career (1955\u201358).  These progressively dynamic compositions paved the way for his works that liberated painting from a flat plane. By 1959, Oiticica\u2019s painterly-sculptural Spatial Reliefs and Nuclei broke free of the wall and entered the space of the viewer. The Nuclei, composed of panels suspended from the ceiling, created areas through which the viewer could walk. His later installations continued to revolutionize the role of the viewer, as they responded to the increasingly oppressive political situation in Brazil under the military dictatorship. Oiticica\u2019s most famous work, Tropic\u00e1lia (1967) brings together a series of clich\u00e9s associated with tropicalness\u2014sand, gravel, exotic birds, and lush foliage\u2014which was contrasted with a television monitor that emits continuous images and sounds. Tropic\u00e1lia, a name subsequently borrowed by the musician Caetano Veloso for his anthem against Brazil\u2019s dictatorship, became a powerful movement in all the arts\u2014a political position both against the right\u2019s conservatism and the left\u2019s desire for a purely Brazilian art.\n\nThroughout his brief but energetic career, Oiticica seamlessly melded formal and social concerns in his art, seeking to be internationally relevant and, at the same time, specifically Brazilian. Above all, he aimed to communicate to his audiences the deep pleasure and satisfaction inherent in creative work. That aim reached fruition as his career advanced and his art took on an increasingly immersive nature, transforming the viewer from a spectator to an active participant or \u201cparticipator.\u201d This exhibition is the first anywhere to treat these later works in depth, acknowledging Oiticica\u2019s New York years (1971\u201378) and his return to Brazil (1978\u201380) as discrete periods within his career. In addition to viewing the original works on display, visitors will be invited to take off their shoes and walk through sand-filled installations, view Amazonian parrots, and try on exhibition copies of Oiticica\u2019s Parangol\u00e9s, objects he created to be carried or worn and among the artist\u2019s most radical contributions to contemporary art.\n\nA fully illustrated catalogue covering the artist\u2019s entire career in essays by authors from the United States and Latin America accompanies the exhibition.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Special tickets are not required for this exhibition. \n\nCharles Sheeler: Across Media\nOctober 7, 2006\u2013January 7, 2007\nRegenstein Hall\n\nCharles Sheeler (1883\u20131965) is recognized as one of the founders of American modernism and one of the master photographers of the twentieth century. His work is synonymous with precisionism, a crisp, clean, hard-edged style that reconciled cubist abstraction and the machine aesthetic of Marcel Duchamp with American subject matter. Trained in industrial drawing, decorative painting, and applied art at the School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia, and having studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Sheeler fully absorbed the lessons of each discipline and forged his own singular approach. \n\nEqually gifted as a photographer and painter, Sheeler analyzed the relationships between photography and traditional artistic methods such as painting and drawing with more rigor and intellectual discipline than perhaps any other American artist of his generation. Like a well-conceived scientific experiment, his practice of using fully realized photographs explicitly as the basis for paintings and drawings led to results that crystallized both the differences and similarities between them. The brilliance and scope of Sheeler\u2019s approach is evident in the way his works in one medium often manage to function as autonomous objects while being inextricably linked to works in other media.\n\nCharles Sheeler: Across Media is the first exhibition to focus upon the complex, often paradoxical relationships between photography, film, drawing, and painting that were central to Sheeler\u2019s art. A celebration of the formal clarity and beauty of the artist\u2019s works, this exhibition draws upon a core of 50 masterpieces, including the magnificent painting Classic Landscape (1931), masterful drawings such as New York (1920) and Counterpoint (1949), and striking examples of the artist\u2019s photographs. The works in this exhibition display Sheeler\u2019s fascination with the visual effects of various media, evident not only in his photographs but also in his works created after them in other media. \n\n\nCATALOGUE\nThe beautifully illustrated catalogue features detailed analyses of Sheeler\u2019s various media and methods and offers new interpretations of critical periods in the artist\u2019s career. The exhibition catalogue is available in the Museum Shop, call 1-800-518-4214.\n\n\nORGANIZERS AND SPONSORS\nThis exhibition is organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\nThis exhibition is made possible through generous support from the Terra Foundation for American Art. \n\nThe exhibition catalogue and brochure were developed by Charles Brock, Assistant Curator of American and British Paintings, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\n\nCURATOR\nSarah E. Kelly, Henry and Gilda Buchbinder Associate Curator of American Art, Art Institute of Chicago\n\n\nOTHER VENUES\nNational Gallery of Art, Washington: May 7\u2013August 27, 2006\nFine Arts Museums of San Francisco, M.H. de Young Memorial Museum: February 10\u2013May 6, 2007",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Epic and luminous, the work of Jeff Wall has overturned nearly every convention of photography. Meticulously staged and theatrical in scale, Wall\u2019s images have more in common with the grandest history painting of the 18th century and the flickering mesmerism of cinema than with the fleeting, documentary style of much of modern photography. Forty-one works of the Vancouver-based artist, who pioneered the use of the light box as a vehicle for displaying photographs, are included in this major retrospective exhibition, previously installed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. \n\nThe size and scale of the works in Jeff Wall, measuring on average 6 feet by 8 feet, are testaments to the ambitions of permanence the artist brings to photography\u2014as grand as monumental painting of the past three centuries, painstakingly staged and constructed, and digitally combined and altered. Wall\u2019s vision and use of photography represent a bold step forward in the reconsideration of this medium as a fine art, equal in stature to painting and sculpture, rather than relegated to a separate sphere of technically driven image-making. Jeff Wall is a rare opportunity to see works produced over nearly three decades, allowing viewers to not only enjoy the dazzling images themselves but to also experience the evolution and development of an artist's career.",

  "title": "Playing with Pictures: The Art of Victorian Photocollage",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "During the Victorian era, photography became remarkably popular and accessible, as people posed for studio portraits and exchanged these pictures on a vast scale. The makers of the collages shown here cut up these portraits and placed them in elaborate watercolor designs in albums. With their sharp wit, absurd senses of humor, and dramatic shifts of scale akin to those Alice experienced in Wonderland, these photocollages stand the rather serious conventions of photography in the 1860s and 1870s on their heads, debunking stuffy Victorian clich\u00e9s with surreal, subversive, and funny images. Oftentimes, the combination of photographic portraits with painted settings inspired dreamlike and even bizarre results: placing human heads on animal bodies; situating people in imaginary landscapes; and morphing faces into common household objects. Such images reveal the educated minds as well as accomplished hands of their makers, as they take on new theories of evolution, the changing role of photography, and the strict boundaries of aristocratic society. Together they provide a fascinating window into the creative possibilities of photography in the Victorian era and enduring inspiration for photographic experimentation today.\nPlaying with Pictures showcases the best of these albums and loose pages from collections across the United States, Europe, and Australia; 40 pages are shown in frames on the wall, while 11 separate albums are displayed in cases, accompanied by \u201cvirtual albums\u201d on computer monitors for visitor interaction. One of the highlights of the exhibition is an exciting addition to the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection: the Madame B Album, a fascinating album of more than 140 pages of photographs and watercolor designs, which was acquired in 2005 and is on public display for the first time. \u201cMadame B\u201d has been identified as Blanche Fournier, the wife of a French diplomat. In her clever, whimsical, and surreal world, photographic portraits dot the tail feathers of a turkey, faces decorate the wings of a colorful butterfly, and a secret language of flowers communicates hidden meanings.",
  "short_description": "Collage is commonly thought of as a modern art form, but the act of \u201cplaying with pictures\u201d has a long, rich, and surprising history. Sixty years ahead of the avant-garde\u2014and more than a century before Photoshop\u2014aristocratic Victorian women were already experimenting with photocollage. This world-premiere exhibition is the first to comprehensively examine this little-known phenomenon, presenting many eye-opening works that have rarely\u2014and in many cases never\u2014before been displayed or reproduced.",

  "description": "In the 1930s, photographers pushed the genre of documentary photography to the forefront of public culture in the United States and onto the walls of newly opened museums and art galleries. That historic development receives new insight with this exhibition focusing exclusively on the work of American photographers Berenice Abbott, Walker Evans, and Margaret Bourke-White.\n\nPhotographic activity flourished in America in the 1930s during the Great Depression, and the genre of documentary emerged as a mode of understanding contemporary events. While the world was in a turbulent state\u2014national and international economies were being severely tested, political systems were in flux, and Europe was preparing again for war\u2014Americans recognized their own viable cultural heritage and sought to record and expand that heritage. Indeed, the country\u2019s literary, artistic, and architectural traditions were fortified in the period\u2019s explosion of popular literature, the founding of new art museums, and the establishment of New Deal government-funded arts programs.\n\nAt the same time, advances in technology, production, and distribution transformed mass media in this country: Americans enjoyed weekly picture magazines, radio broadcasts, and popular movies in unprecedented numbers. Photography played an especially critical role in contemporary culture, appearing in books, newspapers, and magazines as well as being accorded exhibitions in art museums and galleries. Photographs crossed the boundaries between public and private use, impersonal documentation and expressive creation, and popular visual culture and fine art.\n\nAmerican Modern examines the practice of documentary photography through the work of three of the most important photographers of the decade, each of whom contributed a fundamental, independent, and novel idea about documentary to the common pool of artistic practice. For Abbott, it was the notion that photography was a means of critical dialogue and communication. Evans thoroughly investigated the idea that photography has a unique and essential relationship to time. And Bourke-White\u2019s documentary practice fused the logic and pageantry of modern industry with the drama and individual narratives of its subjects.\n\nCatalogue\nA lavishly illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.\n\nSponsor\nThis exhibition is co-organized by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, Texas, and the Colby College Museum of Art in Waterville, Maine.\n\nThe exhibition and accompanying publication have been made possible in part by the National Endowment for the Arts, the Mr. and Mrs. Raymond J. Horowitz Foundation for the Arts, and the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation.\n\nSupport for the Chicago presentation of this exhibition is generously provided in part by the Terra Foundation for American Art.\n\nGenerous support is provided by members of the Exhibitions Trust: Goldman Sachs, Kenneth and Anne Griffin, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, Donna and Howard Stone, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Sullivan, and an anonymous donor.",

Sultan Suleyman I (1494-1566) was a poet and patron of the arts who personally supervised the design for his royal mosque in Isanbul and oversaw the works of the imperial painting studio. Works from Suleyman's imperial painting studio, imperial wardrobe, royal pottery, and sultan's treasury were exhibited in the United States for the first time in this exhibition, alongside illuminated manuscripts, carpets, tiles, and armor.",

  "title": "Benin-Kings and Rituals: Court Arts from Nigeria",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The royal arts of the Benin Kingdom of south-central Nigeria affirm the centrality of the oba, or divine king, portraying his divine nature. While recording the kingdom\u2019s significant historical events and the oba's involvement with them, they also initiate the oba\u2019s interactions with the supernatural and honor his deified ancestors, forging a continuity that is vital to the kingdom\u2019s well-being.\nThe materials used in Benin\u2019s royal arts\u2014primarily brass, ivory, and coral\u2014are endowed with sacred power. The innate value of these materials within Benin and the time and skill that is invested in working them reflect the earthly and otherworldly influence of the oba and the great wealth of his kingdom. Benin\u2019s royal arts belong to a tradition that favors convention even as it promotes creativity and innovation, especially as a reflection of royal prerogative. Through time, rulers have used the arts to interpret the history of the kingdom and to orient themselves with the past in an effort to support their own initiatives and define their images for posterity.\nThrough these extraordinary works of art, the exhibition traces Benin\u2019s history\u2014from its origins in the 13th century to the arrival of Portuguese envoys in the 15th century to the growing wealth of the kingdom from coastal trade in the 16th century. It also looks at themes of kingship, hierarchy, and ritual within Benin\u2019s royal court. The exhibition closes by considering the reconfiguration of Benin\u2019s monarchy after the 1897 invasion by British forces and traces its arts following this course-altering event.",

  "title": "Focus: Richard Hawkins: Third Mind",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Since the early 1990\u2019s, Richard Hawkins has developed an emphatically diverse art practice that resists easy classification. Offering alternate histories through the juxtaposition of decidedly unlike elements\u2014whether ancient Greek and Roman sculpture, 19th-century French Decadent literature, post-structuralist theory, 1980s teen hearthhrobs, Native assimilation in the American Southeast, or the intricacies of Thai sex tourism\u2014the work is, at its core, about the pleasure of intense looking. Hawkins is an equal opportunity voyeur, but it is the male figure\u2014often young, beautiful, and exotic\u2014that is the subject and inspiration in his work. Bolstered by alternative historical precedents or influences and infused each time with new ways of seeing, he takes his subject well beyond personal indulgence into the realm of a deeply engaged rethinking of representation. Critical pairings are primal matter, making collage not simply a medium for Hawkins but a philosophy/methodology that defines his art. His earliest mature statements took the form of collage, and the medium has held firm within his oeuvre ever since. For this reason, Richard Hawkins: Third Mind\u2014the artist\u2019s first American museum survey\u2014is largely focused on his collage-based work as a platform from which to understand his larger practice.\n\nThe title, Third Mind, makes reference to Richard Hawkins: Of two minds simultaneously, the artist\u2019s 2007 exhibition at DeAppel in Amsterdam. The phrase \u201cof two minds\u201d typically means to be undecided, uncertain, or unsure. It is not indecision, however, that is at play in Hawkins\u2019s practice. Rather he is deliberate and indeed mindful in the \u201cduplicity and ambiguity\u201d that characterizes his work. In this way, Third Mind serves as a testament to the artist\u2019s continued propagation of \u201cminds,\u201d made up of a steady stream of thoughts, ideas, desires, fantasies, interactions, possibilities, viewpoints, opportunities, opinions, memories, and meanings. The title also invokes William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin\u2019s 1978 book, The Third Mind, which introduced the concept of the \u201ccut-up\u201d in literature. Inspired by the history of collage in the visual arts and a natural extension of Gysin\u2019s own visual collage practice, the cut-up becomes for the authors an alternative to the \u201ceither-or proposition\u201d and linear declarative sentence structure that \u201cshackles\u201d Western thought and linguistics. Just as Burroughs and Gysin had deconstructed narrative structure through their cut-ups, Hawkins continually reconstructs himself as an artist with a practice that is remarkably unified within constant yet fluid shifts over time and among genres, techniques, and mediums. Inherent to his work is an invitation to feel things at the extremities of human experience and an acknowledgment, even championing of difference, desire, and pleasure as productive ends in themselves.\n\nRichard Hawkins: Third Mind will consist of approximately 80 objects, including books, collages, drawings, paintings, and sculptures spanning his 20-year career. Installed in the Modern Wing\u2019s Abbott Galleries as well as the Ryerson Library, this focus exhibition highlights several major bodies of work with particular consideration of the collage medium as the central mode of Hawkins\u2019s practice.",

The works chosen for exhibition all had variants or counterparts in American museum collections. The exhibition opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art following its run at the Art Institute of Chicago. To supplement the show while it was in Chicago, Art Institute curator Ian Wardropper selected 80 examples of Renaissance decorative arts from Chicago collections to display, including a clock and reliquary that showcased some of the same techniques and ornament used in the bronze statuettes.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "These artists took from Gauguin the challenge to traditional easel painting, especially his notion that all art should be decorative. By making mural-like paintings and screens, they not only developed a new language for picture-making favoring large flat surfaces and allover design, they also returned art to its original function as decoration for a specific interior setting. In addition to at least five splendid folding screens, the exhibition includes and reunites paintings that, although once part of ensembles or series, have since been separated and dispersed into public and private collections. In some instances, the installation evokes the interior for which the works were originally conceived.",
  "short_description": "Beyond the Easel: Decorative Painting by Bonnard, Vuillard, Denis, and Roussel, 1890-1930 is an exhibition of unusually formatted and sometimes very large paintings and screens. Featuring 85 works from around the world, the exhibition explores the importance of decorative paintings from the 1890s to the early decades of the 20th century, focusing on the four artists most closely associated with the genre and also most successful with it; Pierre Bonnard, Edouard Vuillard, Maurice Denis, and Ker Xavier Roussel.",

  "description": "This exhibition focused on the later career of Edgar Degas, between 1886, when he participated in the last Impressionist exhibition, and 1917, the year of his death. In the later years of his life, Degas transitioned from his realist style that has characterized his work theretofore to daring explorations of pattern and color. More than 90 pastels, paintings, and sculptures were assembled from private and public collections for this exhibition. Please note that though the exhibition opened at the Art Institute in 1997, the catalog was published in 1996, in conjunction with the exhibition opening at the National Gallery in London.",

  "title": "Martin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "One of the most renowned artists working today, Martin Puryear is celebrated for his elegant but playful sculpture and his devotion to craft. Lesser known is the extensive iterative process of drawing and printmaking that is essential to the artist\u2019s studio practice. This exhibition is the first to draw back the curtain on that practice. Featuring over 100 drawings and prints as well as 12 sculptures\u2014many borrowed directly from the artist and never displayed before\u2014the presentation offers an unprecedented look into Puryear\u2019s inspirations, methods, and transformative process.\n\nMartin Puryear has had a long relationship with Chicago and the Art Institute. He lived in the city for 12 years, \u2028and the museum has long been supportive of his work\u2014acquiring key pieces in the 1980s, organizing an extensive survey in 1991, and conserving many of his fire-damaged early prints and drawings after that show. Puryear has responded in kind, giving the museum a double-sided drawing for his sculpture Sanctuary and participating \u2028generously and closely in the development of this exhibition, including loaning many works that he has never shared publicly before.\n\nUniting these rarely seen drawings, several sculptures, and selections from his sketchbooks, Martin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions traces the artist\u2019s career from his student days at Catholic University in the early 1960s through the present, with works created as recently as 2014. Critical to Puryear\u2019s development were his formative years spent with the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone (1964\u20131966), a period in which he was inspired by and gave expression to buildings, flora, insects, animals, and children\u2014the entirety of his environment. Since then, Puryear has returned to many of these themes, experimenting with scale, materials, and varying levels of abstraction. In the exhibition, visitors can witness \u2028this evolution of thought\u2014how a sketch of a house in Sierra Leone is transformed 10 years later into an abstracted proto-sculptural form, or how a head-like shape is reworked in bronze, wood, black Cont\u00e9 crayon, and graphite.\n\nBy bringing to life the artist\u2019s uncanny ability to make forms that are suggestive, playful, and transformative, all while remaining anchored in the world, this display of Puryear\u2019s explorations across visual ideas and media offers a 360-degree view of the creative process of a contemporary master.\n\nSponsors\n\nMartin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSupport for the exhibition is provided by the Morton International Exhibition Fund and the Kemper Educational and Charitable Fund.\n\nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v.S. Levy, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, Betsy Bergman Rosenfield and Andrew M. Rosenfield, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, and the Woman\u2019s Board.",

  "title": "Harlequin",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Harlequin is one of the most recognizable and enduring figures of the Commedia dell'Arte, an improvised form of theater performed by masked actors that originated in the mid-16th century in northern Italy but soon spread to the streets and courts of Europe. Commedia dell'Arte troupes were especially popular at the French court, where their performances were enjoyed for nearly two centuries. These shows involved drama, comic skits, and acrobatic routines not necessarily linked to any one story. Stock characters were identified by specific masks, costumes, and accessories. Although these have changed little today, the personalities of the characters have evolved. Harlequin, for example, was originally an oafish but agile figure from the Italian region of Bergamo, whose poverty was symbolized by a costume of multicolored patches. By the late 18th century, he had developed into a quick-witted trickster. His diamond-patterned suit now referred to his physical agility and to his multifaceted nature, at once cunning and foolish, shrewd and absurd.\nThroughout the 19th century, Harlequin and other commedia figures like Polichinelle were regular features in popular entertainments in Paris, such as vaudeville \"harlequinades\" or inexpensive theatrical productions, puppet theaters, caf\u00e9-concerts, and ballets. Harlequin costumes, along with those of other commedia characters like Pierrot (a French addition to the original Italian cast), were available to regular Parisians, who donned them during Mardi Gras celebrations and for other masked balls.\nThis special exhibition, drawn from the Art Institute of Chicago's permanent collection, celebrates the extraordinary loan of Paul C\u00e9zanne's Harlequin from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The works on display by C\u00e9zanne, Edgar Degas, \u00e9douard Manet, and Pablo Picasso speak to the appeal of Harlequin and other commedia figures to avant-garde artists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.",

  "title": "Steve McQueen",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Steve McQueen is an internationally acclaimed artist whose work is primarily engaged with moving images. Born in London in 1969, he has, over the last twenty years, made a series of film and video installations designed for gallery-based presentation, along with two feature films made for cinematic release. His efforts in these two distinct, but interrelated, arenas have earned him a reputation as one of the most important and influential artists of his generation working with these media, and beyond. McQueen's earliest works are silent, and mostly black-and-white, often with a focus on the body, very often the artist\u2019s own. Subsequent pieces incorporate, as a general rule, sound and color, and often emerge from more elaborate investigations.\n\nMcQueen has been equally concerned with the act of recording moving images as he is with the specific conditions in which these images are presented. The size of the screen, the dimensions of the room, and the relationship between the viewer and the projection itself are all fundamental considerations. McQueen's thinking about formal and spatial relationships in this regard lends a sculptural element to his art. One work in particular, Queen and Country (2007\u201309), is an entirely sculptural installation with no moving image or sound component. Presented here for the first time outside of the United Kingdom, the work is a memorial to British men and women killed in military service during the most recent war in Iraq.\n\nMost of McQueen's oeuvre\u2014including his gallery-based installations as well as feature films\u2014evidences a potent, at times oblique, political consciousness. Many works address specific social and historical moments in ways that seemingly emerge from documentary or journalistic impulses. Other films are more abstract, their meanings shaped by allegory or metaphor. McQueen always communicates directly to viewers through what one writer termed \"the medium of aesthetic affect.\"",

  "title": "Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Modern Century",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The two most important developments in photography in the first half of the 20th century were the emergence of lasting artistic traditions and the rise of mass-circulation picture magazines. Henri Cartier-Bresson (1908\u20132004) was a leading figure in both domains. In the early 1930s, he helped to define photographic modernism, using a handheld camera to snatch beguiling images from fleeting moments of everyday life. After World War II, he turned to photojournalism, and the magic and mystery of his early work gave way to an equally uncanny clarity and completeness.\nBefore the dominance of television, most people saw the world through the eyes of picture magazines. Early in Cartier-Bresson\u2019s postwar career, his photographs of Gandhi\u2019s funeral and the Communist revolution in China were journalistic scoops. But the vast majority of his photographs describe everyday events, for his essential subject was society and culture\u2014civilization.\nCartier-Bresson began traveling at the age of 22. For nearly half a century, he was on the road most of the time, and the geographical range of his work is notoriously wide. Its historical range is just as broad\u2014from ancient patterns of preindustrial life to our contemporary era of ceaseless technological change. In the realm of photography, Cartier-Bresson\u2019s work presents a uniquely rich, far-reaching, and challenging account of the modern century.\nThis retrospective exhibition\u2014the first since the photographer\u2019s death in 2004\u2014draws extensively on the collection and generous cooperation of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris.\nAll works in this exhibition are by Henri Cartier-Bresson (French, 1908\u20132004) and are gelatin silver prints. All of the publications on view in vitrines are courtesy of The Museum of Modern Art, New York.",

  "description": "This spring the Art Institute of Chicago joins forces with The Arts Club of Chicago to host a pair of exhibitions featuring the work of Jean-Luc Mylayne (French, born 1946). The shows unite inside and outside, nature and culture, and bring together again two Chicago institutions that have deep historical ties. Further connecting the twin exhibitions is a third element, a public building in Millennium Park\u2019s Lurie Garden featuring a 30-foot-long photographic fresco covering its entire ceiling.\n\nMylayne has devoted four decades to working with common birds as \u201cactors\u201d in a profound investigation of aesthetics and community. The photographs, typically printed at grand dimensions, are each unique and can take months to prepare. Week after week, at a precise place, in a chosen season, Mylayne and his life partner, Myl\u00e8ne Mylayne, set up cumbersome camera equipment and wait until one or more of the individual birds he has previously identified\u2014and who often seem to recognize him in turn\u2014come to occupy the position he had imagined in his picture. \n\nThe Millennium Park building, designed by Chicago architects Dan Wheeler and Joy Meek, is free and open to the public daily 11:00\u20137:00 throughout the exhibition. Calm and hushed, it is a windowless chapel that offers the miraculous image of a solitary sparrow, apparently perched just above our heads, at the exact corner of a square roof under a brilliant, cloudless sky. The bird is doing something nearly inconceivable: allowing a potential predator to approach from underneath. And visitors have the chance to do something rare enough in our times: transcend our self-imposed barriers to join freely with an Other.",

  "title": "Moholy-Nagy: Future Present",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Painting, photography, film, sculpture, advertising, product design, theater sets\u2014L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy (American, born Hungary, 1895\u20131946) did it all. Future Present, the first comprehensive retrospective of Moholy-Nagy\u2019s work in the United States in nearly 50 years, brings together more than 300 works to survey the career of a multimedia artist who was always ahead of his time. Moholy, as he was known, came to prominence as a professor at the Bauhaus art school in Germany (1923\u201328). In 1937 he founded the New Bauhaus in Chicago, a school that continues today as the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology. He remains the most renowned international modern artist ever to have resided in Chicago.\n\nA pioneer of abstraction for the industrial age, Moholy insisted that art must be developed from the materials of one\u2019s time, in his case recorded sound, photography, film, and synthetic plastics. He demonstrated that in our era of reproducibility works of art gain fresh meaning with a change in size or even reorientation, reverse printing, or a shift in lighting. For Moholy, every citizen could be creative, and every viewer could educate his or her senses by studying effects of light, transparency, and motion in common materials of everyday modern life.\n\n\u2028Future Present presents a wide body of works ranging in date from 1920, when the artist moved to Germany, until his death in Chicago in 1946. One room shows 38 photomontages\u2014nearly all known compositions in nearly every physical variant\u2014brought together for the first time. Another presents three \u201ctelephone paintings,\u201d a single abstract composition that Moholy ordered in three sizes from an enamel sign factory in 1923; this trio of industrial paintings has been separated for decades. All six of Moholy\u2019s iconic, plunging views from the Berlin Radio Tower are united in another room, while a multimedia installation, Room of the Present, which Moholy conceived in 1930 but could not finish, is brought to life as a room of its own.\n\n\u2028\u2028Special emphasis is given to Moholy\u2019s time in the United States, where his art moved from planar painterly abstractions to three-dimensional hybrids of painting and sculpture. Never have so many of the artist\u2019s late works in Plexiglas\u2014wall-mounted, freestanding, and hanging in midair\u2014been seen together. These works came from Moholy\u2019s teaching at the \u201cChicago Bauhaus,\u201d which is also highlighted through a showing of student work as well as a \u201cteaching wall\u201d that frames Moholy\u2019s greatest pedagogical ideas. The show closes with Moholy\u2019s recorded voice and a projection of abstract color slides that the artist made in part by recording the scribble-like trace of headlights and taillights on Lake Shore Drive at night.\n\nOrganizers\nMoholy-Nagy: Future Present is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; and Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles.\n\nOther Venues\nSolomon R. Guggenheim Museum: May 27\u2013September 7, 2016\nLos Angeles County Museum of Art: February 12\u2013June 18, 2017\n\nCatalogue\nPurchase Moholy-Nagy: Future Present and experience the exhibition through its accompanying catalogue.

  "title": "Todd Eberle: Architectural Abstractions",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Architecture has been a favored subject of photographers since the invention of the medium in the 19th century. Despite the prevalence of architectural images, their purpose is not always apparent. One persistent problem has been the definition of such works: are they views, deliberately framed by the photographer with artistic intent, or are they commercial endeavors, intended to serve an iconic or illustrative purpose? In 1963 British photographer and author Eric de Mare designed the former type as pictures and the latter as illustrations. But underlying this categorization is the assumption that all architectural photographs reflect a building's figurative, perspectival, three-dimensional qualities that the structure is both identifiable and presented within its environmental context.\n\nTodd Eberle's most recent photographic series breaks away from de Mare's fundamental framework, proposing fresh ways of seeing, thinking about, and interpreting architecture. His radically cropped, totally flat representations of interior surfaces transform the figurative into the abstract. His ostensible subject matter in each picture, which we can ascertain only from the title, is secondary to the work's visual construction as a modular, repetitively patterned surface--most often an interior ceiling plane.\n\nThe artist's framed views of ceilings demonstrate the shared roots of 20th-century modern architecture, Minimalism, and conceptual art. The beauty of the architects' designs, through Eberle's lens, lies in the repetition of formal elements. Illuminated by an indirect light source, these abstracted views can create the effect of a radiating light box with none of the usual visual cues that describe a building's boundaries, structure, texture, or materials.\n\nEberle, who is best known for his pictures of Donald Judd's artwork and buildings in Marfa, Texas, started his career taking photographs of such noted artists and architects as Zaha Hadid, Philip Johnson, Brice Marden, and Agnes Martin. He then expanded into architectural and fashion photography. This presentation of his work comprises 12 large-format (60 x 45 in.)\nphotographs, and highlights include the ceiling outside an elevator bank at Gordon Bunshaft's Lever House, New York (2002); an elevator cab at Chicago's Lake Shore Drive apartments by Mies van der Rohe (2002); and a Frank Lloyd Wright ceiling at Unity Temple in Oak Park (2002).\n\nOrganizer\nTodd Eberle: Architectural Abstractions is organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\nCurator\nJoseph Rosa, Department of Architecture and Design, Art Institute of Chicago\n\nOther Venues\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art, December 16, 2005-March 7, 2006\n\nSponsor\nThe exhibition is generously supported by an anonymous donor.\nTodd Eberle.

One persistent problem has been the definition of such works: are they views, deliberately framed by the photographer with artistic intent, or are they commercial endeavors, intended to serve an iconic or illustrative purpose? In 1963 British photographer and author Eric de Mare designed the former type as pictures and the latter as illustrations.",

The exhibition commemorates the centennial of powered, controlled flight that began with the landmark take off of the Wright brothers on December 17, 1903.\n\nObjects included in the exhibition date back to NASA\u2019s predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), founded in 1915. Created out of that agency at the beginning of the space race in 1958, NASA has a wealth of often unexhibited and unpublished artifacts that not only document technological advances in flight over the past century but are also aesthetically striking. Beyond the historic dimension, the exhibition showcases some of the latest research being done for aircrafts with \"morphing\" wings, self-healing vehicle \"skins\" and biologically inspired sensors\u2014elements that NASA hopes will make future air travel accident free, environmentally friendly, and affordable and accessible. In all, the project presents the history of aeronautically engineered forms in relation to architecture and design, much as previous Art Institute exhibitions have analyzed architecture and design for commercial aviation, space travel, and contemporary railroad travel. Visitors are shown another example of how aviation design is as beautiful as it can be functional.",

  "description": "Special tickets ARE NOT required for this exhibition. Enjoy the exhibition during regular museum hours.\n\nThis major international exhibition provides a detailed survey of the art of Florence during the years that Michelangelo and artists employed by the first Medici grand dukes\u2014such as Cellini, Bronzino, and Pontormo\u2014produced celebrated masterpieces. Works by these artists bolstered the wordly power and status of the ruling family and reflected the sophistication and refinement of Florentine court circles, in which high value was placed upon classical aesthetics and scientific learning. Many of the 200 objects in the exhibition\u2014including sculpture, painting, armor, medals, porcelain, and tapestries\u2014have never before traveled out of Florence. Among the objects on view for the first time in the United States are three sculptures by Michelangelo, some of the greatest paintings of the Uffizi and Pitti Galleries, and works from the famed Studiolo (treasure room) of Francesco I in the Palazzo Vecchio.\n\nThe Medici, Michelangelo, and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence is the first major exhibition in North America devoted to this moment of great achievement and artistic innovation, one of the richest periods in the history of art. Before coming to the Art Institute, the exhibition opened at the Strozzi Palace in Florence. After leaving Chicago it will be seen at the Detroit Institute of Arts.\n\n\nCatalogue\nA fully illustrated, scholarly exhibition catalogue, published by the Yale University Press in association with the Detroit Institute of Arts, accompanies the show.\n\nCurators\nLarry Feinberg, Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Curator of European Painting, the Art Institute; Alan P. Darr, Walter B. Ford II Family Curator of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, the Detroit Institute of Arts; Marco Chiarini, director emeritus, Palazzo Pitti, Florence\n\n\nCollaborators\nThe Medici, Michelangelo, and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence was organized by The Detroit Institute of Arts, the Soprintendenza Speciale per il Polo Museale Fiorentino, and the Opificio delle Pietre Dure of Florence, Italy, with the close collaboration of the The Art Institute of Chicago and the Firenze Mostre, Florence.

  "title": "Ralph Eugene Meatyard: Dolls and Masks",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Ralph Eugene Meatyard (1925\u20131972) has been on the fringes of photographic history\u2014so much so that he inserted one of his own prints into his personal copy of Beaumont Newhall\u2019s classic History of Photography, which did not include him. And yet his impact on photographic practice, belatedly recognized, has been significant. An optician in Lexington, Kentucky, Meatyard sustained a life-long interest in visual perception. Well read and deeply connected to a circle of poets and philosophers, he made photographs rich in literary allusion. Meatyard\u2019s photography was not accidental or documentary, but rather deliberate, often staged, and searching for inner truths rather than ephemeral surfaces.\n\nIn his last decade, Meatyard kept returning to the tropes of dolls and masks, often photographing his children posed in abandoned houses and landscapes. These pictures put an uncanny spin on family photographs, exploring the contrasts between youth and age, childhood and mortality, intimacy and unknowability, sharing and hiding. For Meatyard, dolls represented a physical human presence, whether employed in a scene alongside people or instead of people. He used masks to universalize his sitters rather than make portraits of individuals. Masks reflect the faces we all put on for the camera; indeed, Meatyard\u2019s last project before his untimely death was The Family Album of Lucybelle Crater, a project based on the common snapshot album but featuring friends and family all wearing masks. Drawn from the photographer\u2019s estate, this focused exhibition\u2014all of works made before that iconic project\u2014examines dolls and masks across different bodies of work as a window onto this enigmatic photographer\u2019s larger practice.\n\nThis exhibition is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Special tickets are not required for this exhibition.\n\nGirodet: Romantic Rebel\nFebruary 11\u2013April 30, 2006\nRegenstein Hall\n\nGirodet: Romantic Rebel is the first retrospective in the United States devoted to the works of gifted French painter Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson (1767\u20131824). The exhibition assembles more than 100 seminal works (about 60 paintings and 40 drawings) that demonstrate the artist\u2019s impressive range as a painter as well as a draftsman. \n\nProfoundly shaped by the dramatic social and political upheaval brought about by the French Revolution, Girodet early on broke free from his mentor Jacques-Louis David\u2019s influence and veered away from the rigid Neoclassical style then prevalent in France. He interpreted his subjects in an evocative and dreamlike manner, often adding a strange, erotic charge. Increasingly he explored themes of a more Romantic nature, taking up subjects that involved irrational emotions and the exotic. He executed pictures representing the legends of Ossian, a fanciful Nordic myth contrived by contemporary writer James Macpherson; and the tragic story of the American Indian woman, Atala, based on the eponymous novel by the artist\u2019s friend, Romantic writer Chateaubriand. Also featured in the exhibition are some of the artist\u2019s exotic fantasies, including several drawn and painted studies for the spectacular Revolt of Cairo (1810), a depiction of a Mameluke rebellion in Cairo during Napoleon\u2019s 1798 Egyptian campaign.\n\nIn the range of subjects that he embraced\u2014from family portraits, to mythological fantasies, to Napoleonic battle scenes\u2014Girodet constantly reinvented his style and expanded the boundaries of what was considered appropriate by the French art establishment. His penchant for unconventional interpretation of traditional subjects and his tendency to produce controversial works brought him fame as well as constant challenge. In his innovative exploration of new and exotic themes, visual effects, and untoward or violent emotions, Girodet was an early proponent of what came to be called the Romantic movement in art and literature.\n\n\nCATALOGUE\nThe exhibition catalogue, Girodet: Romantic Rebel, will be available in spring 2006. $65, hardcover. Please contact the Museum Shop at (312) 443-3533 for purchase information.\n\n\nORGANIZERS AND SPONSORS\nThis exhibition was initiated by the Cleveland Museum of Art and organized by the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre and the R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, Paris, in collaboration with the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, in cooperation with the Mus\u00e9e Girodet, Montargis.\n\nThis exhibition is made possible by the Old Masters Society of the Art Institute of Chicago, and through generous contributions from Marilynn Alsdorf; Scott, Lynda, Jonathan, and Lindsey Canel; Alexandra and John Nichols; and Patrick G. and Shirley W.

  "title": "Zarina: Paper Like Skin",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The Art Institute is thrilled to welcome the first retrospective of Indian-born American artist Zarina. Organized by the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, this long-overdue survey traces Zarina\u2019s career from 1961 to the present and features approximately 60 works from the artist\u2019s studio, as well as from public and private collections.\n\nZarina Hashmi was born in Aligarh, India, in 1937 and has lived and worked in New York for the past 30 years. Her main medium is paper, which she employs in woodcuts,\netchings, drawings, rubbings, and casts made from paper pulp. Although she is primarily a printmaker, she considers herself to be a sculptor as well, in part because the activity of carving blocks of wood is central to her practice.\n\nZarina\u2019s vocabulary is minimal yet rich in associations. Her abstract compositions are inextricably linked to her life and to the themes of dispossession and exile that have marked it. Her family is Muslim but chose to stay in India following the partition of 1947, which resulted in the uprooting and deaths of millions of people. Conditions in India eventually made it impossible for them to remain any longer, but by the time her parents chose to immigrate to Pakistan in 1959, Zarina was married and living in Thailand. She was unable to return to her childhood home and was also not \u201cat home\u201d in Pakistan. She later lived in Germany, France, and Japan before settling in the United States. The concept of home\u2014whether personal, geographical, national, spiritual, or familial\u2014resonates throughout Zarina\u2019s work. The lines that define her spaces are never anonymous; on the contrary, they are handcrafted and calligraphic. Although it appears in different guises throughout her oeuvre, her distinctive sense of line is the unifying element of her compositions, like an umbilical cord that ties her to this world regardless of where she is.\n\nZarina, who chooses to be referred to simply by her first name, was a prominent figure in feminist circles of the New York art scene in the 1970s. While her work has been featured in major exhibitions and is represented in important public collections, including those of the Hammer Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, this exhibition marks the most comprehensive survey to date of her strikingly beautiful, contemplative, and poetic oeuvre.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "One of England\u2019s most important artists and independent filmmakers, and a founder of the pioneering Sankofa Film and Video Collective (1983\u201392), Isaac Julien creates highly seductive films and video installations that explore the representation of race and masculinity in visual culture.\n\nConflating conventional cinematic structure with avant-garde techniques, Julien subverts stereotypical portrayals of black and gay subjects, forcing viewers to question accepted representational archetypes. Produced collaboratively with Venezuela-born choreographer Javier De Frutos, The Long Road to Mazatl\u00e1n is a modern cowboy story. Shot in and around San Antonio, Texas, the film captures the erotically charged interchanges between a young Hispanic man and the emotionally unavailable cowboy he pursues. Shot in lush color and layered imagery, the protagonists play out, as actors and at times as dancers, the subtle drama of the everyday, performing within carefully constructed environments. Through selected editing and the use of a three-screen installation, the artist composes a mise-en-sc\u00e8ne that explores the social construction of masculinity within the mythic landscape of the American West.\n\nThe Long Road to Mazatl\u00e1n was originally commissioned by Artpace San Antonio.",

  "title": "Christopher Williams: The Production Line of Happiness",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "With a career spanning 35 years, Christopher Williams (born 1956) now stands as one of the leading contemporary artists engaged in photography. Deeply invested in the techniques and history of photography, Williams is just as profoundly committed to contemporary art as a forum for intellectual inquiry and thoughtful opposition\u2014resisting, for example, a capitalist society in which photographs typically act as agents of consumer spectacle. Through exacting mimicry\u2014and stunningly beautiful images\u2014Williams\u2019s work has subtly questioned the conventions of photojournalism, picture archives, fashion, and commercial imaging. This exhibition\u2014a multipart installation conceived by the artist that spans three gallery spaces on three floors of the museum\u2014is Williams\u2019s first retrospective. It also marks a homecoming for the artist, who had his first-ever museum showing in 1982 at the Art Institute.\n\nThe survey begins with films from Williams\u2019s studies at the California Institute of the Arts, where he earned his MFA in 1981 and took classes with John Baldessari and Michael Asher. Alongside the films and SOURCE (1981), Williams\u2019s first mature work, is a classic early piece, Angola to Vietnam* (1989), shown in its 27-part entirety, as well as works of the 1990s, mainly from For Example: Die Welt ist sch\u00f6n (1993\u20132001), an eight-year project inspired in part by the 1920s photographs of Albert Renger-Patzsch. This part of the exhibition is presented in the photography galleries in the historic building, which the artist is transforming through interventions to the modular wall system.\n\nThe Modern Wing\u2019s Bucksbaum Gallery for Photography displays a single photograph, a key piece in which Williams first made clear his conception of photographs as a form of installation art, Bouquet for Bas Jan Ader and Christopher d\u2019Arcangelo (1991). Extensive selections from Williams\u2019s ongoing project, For Example: Dix-huit Le\u00e7ons sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 industrielle (begun in 2004), are presented in the architecture and design galleries on the second floor of the Modern Wing.\n\nUnited across all three levels of the museum by the artist\u2019s use of \u201csupergraphics\u201d\u2014lengthy text excerpts printed at enormous size on a boldly colored background\u2014The Production Line of Happiness offers 35 years of beautifully made, conceptually rich photography that mines the history of contemporary art and modern political opposition. After its debut at the Art Institute, the exhibition will travel to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Whitechapel Gallery, London.",

  "title": "William Eggleston: Democratic Camera, Photographs and Video, 1961-2008",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "One of the most influential American artists, William Eggleston changed the history of color photography. This exhibition\u2014the artist\u2019s first retrospective in the United States\u2014brings together Eggleston\u2019s famous color photographs of the American South with lesser-known works, such as his early black-and-white prints and provocative video recordings.\n\nA key figure of the last half-century, Eggleston is often credited for singlehandedly ushering in the era of color art photography. His motivation was simple and decidedly everyday: \u201cI had wanted to see a lot of things in color because the world is in color.\u201d His achievement is patently more extraordinary\u2014transforming ordinary moments into indelible images.\n\nThis exhibition, which fills the Modern Wing\u2019s Abbott Galleries and Carolyn S. and Matthew Bucksbaum Gallery, demonstrates Eggleston\u2019s democratic approach to his photographic subjects in both color and black-and-white. On display are Eggleston\u2019s remarkable black-and-white images from the early 1960s and his little-seen recording of 1970s Memphis nightlife, Stranded in Canton. These works only amplify his achievement in bringing a detailed sensitivity to his iconic color photographs\u2014telling portrayals of American culture, including a freezer stuffed with food, Elvis\u2019s Graceland, and a supermarket clerk corralling grocery carts in the afternoon sunlight.\n\nInternationally acclaimed, Eggleston has spent the past four decades photographing around the world, responding intuitively to fleeting configurations of cultural signs and specific expressions of local color. Psychologically complex and casually refined, bordering on kitsch and never conventionally beautiful, these photographs have had a pervasive influence on many contemporary artists. By not censoring, rarely editing, and always photographing even the seemingly banal, Eggleston convinces us completely of the idea of the democratic camera.\n\nThis exhibition will be closed on Friday, May 7 due to the School of the Art Institute's 2010 Fashion Show. \n\nPlease note that some of the exhibition's videos contain potentially disturbing content.",

  "title": "Dennis Oppenheim: Projection",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The three slide projections in this presentation, shown together in 1975 but rarely seen since, mark a point of intersection between land art and body art\u2014two areas pioneered by sculptor and media artist Dennis Oppenheim (American, 1938\u20132011). In these intimate and personal works, the artist used performances for the camera to explore the theme of mourning and to model an intergenerational transfer of psychic or creative energies. Shot from a helicopter, 2000' Shadow Projection (1972), shows the artist alone in a field, standing in the stark beam of a far-reaching searchlight; he repeatedly plays a one-note dirge on a trumpet, an act of memorial to his father, who had died the same year. In Ground Gel #2 (1972), also photographed from above, he whirls his young daughter, Chandra, round and round, their figures appearing to merge with each other as well as with the ground as the slides progress. Whispering, \u201cI want to go there...\u201d as he whirls his daughter around, Oppenheim propels an exchange of action and energy that seems to exceed the material boundaries of his own bodily form. Grandfather and granddaughter meet symbolically in the third work, Polarities (1972). Using red magnesium flares, Oppenheim created two \u201clandscape drawings,\u201d together stretching more than 1,000 feet, by plotting enlarged versions of a doodle drawn by his father the night before he died and one of Chandra\u2019s first artworks.\n\nSlides give a perfect metaphor for themes of separation and interdependence, causing images to shift and dissolve like the bodies they symbolize or depict. \u201cMy work,\u201d Oppenheim described in 1973, \u201clies on the attempt to remove the frontier between an action directed from within the bounds of my life and the one I try to direct, at the same time, beyond those bounds.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition is presented jointly by the Department of Photography and the Department of Modern and Contemporary Art. A selection of related lithographs by Dennis Oppenheim, recent gifts of Irving Stenn, Jr., is on view nearby in Gallery 189.",

  "title": "Ancient Chinese Bronzes from the Shouyang Studio: The Katherine and George Fan Collection (working title)",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "For the ruling elite of ancient China, prestigious objects of bronze signified supreme political power, devout spiritual beliefs, and exalted social status. Foremost among these bronzes are vessels that were used for the ritual preparation and offering of food and drink to deceased ancestors. Beginning in about 1200 B.C., many of these bronzes were cast with pictographic images or insignia and sometimes with archaic forms of Chinese written characters. Whether naming an honoree, recounting a military campaign, or declaring an imperial edict, such inscriptions preserve firsthand, if highly formulaic, records of their time. Inscribed bronzes also present us with some of the earliest evidence for China\u2019s most prized cultural possession\u2014its written language.\n\nOver the past millennium, ancient bronzes have been collected and studied by Chinese intellectuals, who have valued inscriptions as direct links to antiquity. Today, both Western and Chinese scholars continue this epigraphic tradition while also benefiting from important insights gleaned from ongoing archaeological finds. Among the most eminent proponents of these historical perspectives are the collectors George and Katherine Fan of New York, who have chosen \u201cShouyang\u201d as the traditional \u201cstudio\u201d name for their bronze collection.\n\nThis exhibition features 72 bronzes collected by the Fans over more than 20 years. Also included is a set of models that illustrates the technique of piece-mold casting distinctive to ancient Chinese foundries. The Shanghai Museum, where the exhibition opened in 2009, has generously lent this reconstruction, as well as ink impressions (rubbings) of all inscriptions and prominent surface designs. Together with the bronzes, these materials illuminate historical, epigraphic, stylistic, and technical developments that span almost two millennia, from the early Bronze Age through China\u2019s first centralized empire.",

  "title": "Making Place: The Architecture of David Adjaye",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "With over 50 built projects across the world, David Adjaye is rapidly emerging as a major international figure in architecture and design. Rather than advancing a signature architectural style, Adjaye\u2019s structures address local concerns and conditions through both a historical understanding of context and a global understanding of modernism. The first comprehensive museum survey devoted to Adjaye, this exhibition offers an in-depth overview of the architect\u2019s distinct approach and visual language with a dynamic installation design conceived by Adjaye Associates.\n\nOf African ancestry and raised in Ghana, the Middle East, and England, Adjaye now has offices in London, New York, Berlin, and Accra. Like many international architects, he is itinerant, and his practices defy cultural borders and geopolitical categories. However, Adjaye is unique in being an African-born architect working in a global landscape. Having traveled the world studying buildings and architectural styles, most recently and extensively in Africa, he is acutely sensitive to the effects of location. A proponent for architecture from beyond the Western canon, he brings a distinctive contemporary \u201cAfropolitan\u201d view to his various projects.\n\nWhile Adjaye has never adhered to a discrete style, his projects coalesce around certain ideas. Often set in cities struggling with diversity and difference, his public buildings provide spaces that foster links among people and explore how neighborhoods evolve, how new communities are created, and how unexpected junctures weave diverse urban identities and experiences into the tapestry of multiculturalism. Rethinking conventions, his designs speak to the specific time and place in which they were made. These ideas are expressed in important recent projects, such as the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., a building that faces history head-on, bringing together references from across Africa and America in a visually and physically evocative design.\n\nThis exhibition, comprising furniture, housing, public buildings, and master plans, fills the first-floor Abbott Galleries and the second-floor architecture and design galleries in the Modern Wing. In addition to drawings, sketches, models, and building mock-ups, a specially commissioned film featuring Adjaye\u2019s collaborators\u2014an international roster of artists, the exhibition curators, and other influential figures in the art world\u2014helps bring his projects to life and makes clear the important role that Adjaye plays in contemporary architecture today.\n\nSponsors\nMaking Place: The Architecture of David Adjaye is organized by Haus der Kunst, Munich, and the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nMajor funding has been generously provided by Nancy Carrington Crown and A. Steven Crown and Barbara Bluhm-Kaul and Don Kaul.\n\nThe Auxiliary Board of the Art Institute of Chicago is the Lead Affiliate Sponsor.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue, David Adjaye: Form, Heft, Material, has been underwritten by Nancy Carrington Crown and A. Steven Crown.\n\nAdditional support for the exhibition has been provided by the Fellows and Benefactors of the Architecture and Design Department, the Architecture & Design Society, the Leadership Advisory Committee, Cheryl and Eric McKissack, the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, and Linda Johnson Rice.\n\nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v. S. Levy, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, and the Woman\u2019s Board.",

  "title": "Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "This exhibition on the art of Roy Lichtenstein (American, 1923\u20131997) included nearly 170 works made between 1950 and 1997, focusing on the artist's achievements in painting, sculpture, and drawing. It was the first major retrospective to broadly examine his art since his death.\nLichtenstein is a figure of monumental importance in the recent history of art. His contribution\u2014the still-potent collision of commercial sources and fine art\u2014defined the enduring legacy of Pop Art. The idea of compositional unity was central to the artist's thinking. Plastic values such as beauty and balance were of primary importance to Lichtenstein, and reliable formal tropes\u2014outlines, halftone dots, and solid diagonals\u2014were the building blocks of nearly all his compositions.\nThe first phase of Lichtenstein's mature career was defined by his \"cartoon\" mode. After 1966 he applied his comic style to a broad range of found imagery. The artist almost always began with a two-dimensional source, often a comic image or another readily distillable form of printed mass communication. He then sketched the image, recomposing it to suit narrative clarity or formal ends. Subsequently, he traced the drawing onto canvas, continuing to make compositional adjustments, and then painted the work, sometimes with the aid of assistants.\nThe tactile sites\u2014in print media\u2014from which Lichtenstein's art emerged are growing progressively extinct. More than 50 years after his opening salvo, his work seems wiser than ever in its insistence on the authority of the artificial. Ultimately, there is a profound radicalness in his project, more extreme than the initially transgressive embrace of pop culture. Impeccable sleight of hand is Lichtenstein's revolutionary stance. In restating the mass-produced image by means of an insistently handmade, painterly process, he confounded the notion of the readymade and forever expanded and altered our understanding of how a painting can be made, how it should look, and how we define the artist in our society.",

  "title": "Beyond Golden Clouds: Japanese Screens from the Art Institute of Chicago and the Saint Louis Art Museum",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Part utilitarian and part fine art, the Japanese folding screen has captured the imaginations of those in the West since the 16th century. Japanese screens were then, as they are now, the decorated surface par excellence, connoting status, good taste, and indeed, Japan itself. Stretching across their surfaces are, for the most part, compositions of bright mineral pigments rendered on gleaming gold-leaf grounds. Unfortunately, however varied the subjects portrayed and the painting styles adopted, there are very few opportunities today to see large numbers of screens displayed together at once, and museum visitors often must satisfy themselves with only one or two examples at a time. With Beyond Golden Clouds: Japanese Screens from the Art Institute of Chicago and the Saint Louis Art Museum, we seek to reveal the dynamism of the screen format\u2014its lasting meaning in Japan and its persistent appeal abroad\u2014presented in both premodern and contemporary incarnations.\nThe exhibition celebrates the possibilities of the screen format in a way only the collaboration of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Saint Louis Art Museum could achieve, drawing as it does on the Art Institute\u2019s strength in decorative and iconic screens of the seventeenth century and Saint Louis\u2019s pivotal calligraphic screens and contemporary works. An extensive full-color catalogue edited by myself and including contributions by top scholars in the field will be available in June.",

  "title": "Charles Ray: Sculpture, 1997-2014",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The first major exhibition devoted to celebrated Chicago-born, Los Angeles\u2013based sculptor Charles Ray since a midcareer retrospective in 1998, this display of 19 works fills the second floor of the Modern Wing and flows into the museum\u2019s South Garden, presenting a full range of Ray\u2019s most recent achievements with particular emphasis on figurative experiments. The exhibition, co-organized by the Art Institute and the Kunstmuseum Basel, can only be seen in the United States at the Art Institute, and six sculptures\u2014including four new works in their museum debut: Horse and Rider, Huck and Jim, Silver, and Girl on Pony\u2014are on view only in Chicago.\n\nOn technical and formal levels, Ray has been redefining the possibilities of contemporary sculptural practice since the early 1980s. His recent pioneering use of solid, machined aluminum and stainless steel is entirely new to the history of art, its reflective qualities and fluid effects belying the tremendous weight of many of Ray\u2019s life-size and over-life-size works. As the exhibition demonstrates, Ray\u2019s latest sculptures evidence a verisimilitude that can range in a single work from painstakingly exact to a softer, more stylized rendering. The works, materially and conceptually dense, often emerge from a long process of study, experimentation, refinement, and meticulous execution. Ray himself has described his objects not as the product of an obsessive practice but rather as the manifestation of \u201cdiscipline and persistence.\u201d With works sometimes ten years in the making, Ray\u2019s process can be likened to a river eroding or reshaping stones over time. \n\nThis intensive working method, along with the sculptures\u2019 highly technical creation and carefully controlled display, yields works that are timeless yet utterly contemporary. Throughout the exhibition, viewers can trace themes of boyhood, sleep, ghosts, self-portraiture, and myths of American popular culture, as well as recognize references to Classical statues and the revival of ancient techniques such as bas relief. Yet there are also many conceptual aspects to Ray\u2019s work\u2014space and time, physical and psychological presence\u2014that form a matrix of migrating allusions and allegorical meaning.",

  "description": "Timothy H. O\u2019Sullivan (1840\u20131882) was one of the most important American photographers of the nineteenth century. While employed by Mathew B. Brady and Alexander Gardner, O\u2019Sullivan made iconic images of the American Civil War. After the war, O\u2019Sullivan served as the official photographer for three U.S. government survey expeditions: the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel (or \u201cKing Survey\u201d) of 1867\u201369 and 1872; the Darien (Isthmus of Panama) Expedition of 1870; and the Geological Surveys West of the 100th Meridian (or \u201cWheeler Survey\u201d) of 1871 and 1873\u201374. His images of the West are of great historical and artistic significance: working alongside geologists, naturalists, and surveyors, O\u2019Sullivan produced some of the earliest and most influential photographs of the American frontier.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan\u2019s work in the King Survey\u2014which covered an 800-mile-long swath of land, roughly straddling the path of the transcontinental rail route, from southern Wyoming to the California line\u2014is of particular importance to his career and to the history of American photography. His photographs of barren landscapes, notable or curious geological formations, and mining operations represent a raw, powerful vision of this little-understood territory increasingly occupied by white Americans. In addition, these images have remained challenging touchstones in photographic history\u2014a perfect, if enigmatic, union of documentary and artistic intentions, fact and interpretation. While a few of these images have been widely reproduced, original prints are remarkably rare. Timothy H. O\u2019Sullivan: The King Survey Photographs includes photographs contextualized with contemporaneous survey reports and topographical and geological atlases that show visual depictions of the land across media.\n\nThis exhibition has been organized by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. In Chicago, this exhibition is made possible by the Smart Family Foundation.\n\nOrganizer\nThis exhibition has been organized by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.\n\nSponsor\nGenerous support for the presentation at the Art Institute of Chicago is provided by the Smart Family Foundation.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Seeking to make \u201ceveryday objects shriek aloud,\u201d or make the familiar unfamiliar, Belgian artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte created some of the 20th century\u2019s most extraordinary\u2014and indelible\u2014images. This exhibition, the first major museum show to focus on the artist\u2019s most profoundly inventive and experimental years, features over 100 paintings, collages, drawings, and objects, along with a selection of photographs, periodicals, and early commercial work, that trace the birth of the themes and strategies Magritte would go on to use throughout his long, productive career\u2014and which make his paintings so unforgettable today.\n\nThe exhibition begins in 1926 in Brussels, where Magritte created paintings and works on paper that first gained him recognition as a Surrealist and that aimed, in his words, to \u201cchallenge the real world.\u201d It follows the artist to Paris in 1927, where he met Surrealists like Andr\u00e9 Breton, Salvador Dal\u00ed, and Joan Mir\u00f3, and created his first breakthrough word-image paintings such as his legendary The Treachery of Images, perhaps better known by its playfully perplexing message, \u201cCeci n\u2019est pas une pipe.\u201d Returning to Brussels in 1930, Magritte continued his search for new forms of image making and in 1933 began a series of paintings that provoked disturbing and unexpected associations between things that make the ordinary and daily life strange.\n\nThe exhibition concludes with a remarkable group of works Magritte made in London and in Brussels between 1937 and 1938, with a particular emphasis on the commissions he completed for the eccentric British collector Edward James, including the Art Institute\u2019s own Time Transfixed. The show\u2019s chronological endpoint, 1938, marks both a historically and biographically significant moment: it was just before the outbreak of World War II and the year Magritte delivered an important retrospective account of what had made him a Surrealist painter.\n\nThroughout these seminal years, Magritte used displacement, transformation, metamorphosis, and the \u201cmisnaming\u201d of objects as well as the representation of visions seen in half-waking states, consistently unsettling the balance between nature and artifice, truth and fiction, reality and surreality. His images, then and still today, force us to question the nature of appearances\u2014both in the paintings and in reality itself.",

  "title": "America after the Fall: Painting in the 1930s",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "What is American art? That is a question the country\u2019s artists asked and answered in myriad ways during the decade spanning the economic crash of 1929 through America\u2019s entry into World War II. With economic downturn at home and the rising threat of fascism abroad, artists of the time applied their individualized visions of the nation to rethinking modernism. This exhibition brings together 50 works by some of the foremost artists of the era\u2014including Edward Hopper, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and Grant Wood\u2014to examine the landscape of the United States during the Great Depression and the many avenues artists explored as they sought to forge a new national art and identity.\n\nCollectively, the aesthetically and politically varied works produced in the 1930s paint a revealing portrait of the nation\u2019s evolving psyche. Edward Hopper\u2019s reflective, melancholy approach to homegrown subjects is quite different from the bold romanticism of Thomas Hart Benton and his fellow Regionalists, who sought to create a national art that glorified America. Painters such as Philip Evergood and Ben Shahn used social realism to protest political attitudes of the time, highlighting the plights of migrant sharecroppers, Jewish immigrants, and other marginalized members of society. Racial issues also came to the fore: Joe Jones chillingly depicted a lynching in American Justice, while Aaron Douglas inserted a more inclusive vision of black culture into the heroic histories of the United States. History, in fact, was frequently used to speak to present times; realist Charles Sheeler linked the earlier, spare American aesthetic of Shaker objects to his exploration of the contemporary, while Grant Wood took on the country\u2019s founding myths in works such as Parson Weems\u2019 Fable.\n\nAt the same time, other artists reinvigorated the revolt against representational style, championing nonobjective art as a form that spoke deeply to modern concerns. The Park Avenue Cubists continued to evolve a European-based abstraction, and modernists such as Stuart Davis and Charles Demuth applied a precise, geometric vocabulary to American architecture and advertising.\n\nBringing these diverse works of art together, America after the Fall tells the story of a nation\u2019s fall from grace and irrevocable changes to the American dream. Following its installation at the Art Institute, the exhibition travels to the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie in Paris and London\u2019s Royal Academy, marking the first time many of these iconic American works\u2014including Grant Wood\u2019s American Gothic\u2014have journeyed beyond North America. For French and British audiences, this traveling exhibition offers an unprecedented opportunity to experience these masterpieces firsthand. For all the show\u2019s visitors, the presentation affords a trailblazing look at the turbulent economic, political, and aesthetic world of the 1930s and the critical and dynamic process of rethinking modernism that it fostered.",

  "description": "Anne Imhof is one of the most important and pioneering artists of her generation, as her work establishes a new paradigm for performance art and gives form and voice to the lingering alienation that is so tangible in contemporary society. In Imhof\u2019s durational performance and installation projects, the complex of technology, isolation, and identity is manifested in both the bodies of the performers and the architecture of the installation. Glass partitions, steel constructions, and uncanny structures become the arena in which a choreographed group of performers and musicians exist, both detached from each other and moving in unison. \n\nHer work Faust was presented in the German Pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennial in 2017, for which she was awarded the prestigious Golden Lion, and her groundbreaking installation Angst was shown at Kunsthalle Basel and Hamburger Bahnhof in 2016. At the Art Institute\u2014for her first solo museum exhibition in the United States\u2014Imhof builds on the aesthetic of these previous projects and combines music, choreography, painting, and sculpture to stage a new installation commissioned specifically for the museum.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In 1887 Ambroise Vollard (1866\u20131939) arrived in Paris with few contacts and no credentials to pursue a career as an art dealer. He began representing artists that were undervalued, exhibiting them at a time when many galleries were not willing to take the risk. In 1895 Vollard hosted C\u00e9zanne\u2019s first solo exhibition, and in doing so he made the artist\u2019s reputation as well as his own.\n\nBy the early 20th century, Vollard had become the principal dealer of artists such as Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin, and a number of Fauve artists, and lent early support to artists who are well known today\u2014Pierre Bonnard, Aristide Maillol, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Edouard Vuillard\u2014as well as many who remain relatively unknown. His shrewd mind for business and artistic sense made him the leading contemporary art dealer of his generation.\n\nC\u00e9zanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde draws upon the dealer\u2019s archives\u2014handwritten sale and purchase records, stockbooks, photography, and correspondence\u2014to shed new light not only on Vollard\u2019s business strategies but also on the heretofore unexplored story of his relationships with artists whose work he exhibited and sold. The exhibition underscores Vollard\u2019s achievement in promoting careers and styles to collectors, art critics, and artists, who used his gallery as a meeting place to discuss and buy modern art. Special galleries devoted to individual artists feature works from Vollard\u2019s most important exhibitions, including paintings from his groundbreaking 1895 C\u00e9zanne show, a never-before reassembled triptych from Vollard\u2019s 1896 Van Gogh retrospective, and, from Gauguin\u2019s important 1898 exhibition of Tahitian works, the masterpiece Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? lent by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and on view for the first time ever in Chicago.\n\nThe exhibition also highlights Vollard\u2019s importance as a creative catalyst for artists who, in response to his urging, experimented in making a variety of artworks including color print albums, livres d\u2019artiste (limited-edition artists\u2019 books), sculpture, and decorated ceramics. The many and varied portraits of Vollard featured in the exhibition underscore his close relationships to artists and his brilliance as a self-promoter.",

  "description": "Were the Impressionists fashionistas? And what role did fashion play in their goal to paint modern life with a \u201cmodern\u201d style? This is the subject of the internationally acclaimed exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity, the first to uncover the fascinating relationship between art and fashion from the mid-1860s through the mid-1880s as Paris became the style capital of the world. Featuring 75 major figure paintings by Caillebotte, Degas, Manet, Monet, Renoir, and Seurat, including many never before seen in North America, this stylish show presents a new perspective on the Impressionists\u2014revealing how these early avant-garde artists embraced fashion trends as they sought to capture modern life on canvas.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the modern fashion industry was born: designers like Charles Frederick Worth were transforming how clothing was made and marketed, department stores were on the rise, and fashion magazines were beginning to proliferate. Visual artists and writers alike were intrigued by this new industry; its dynamic, ephemeral, and constantly innovative qualities embodied the very essence of modernity that they sought to express in their work and offered a means of discovering new visual and verbal expressions.\n\nThis groundbreaking exhibition explores the vital relationship between fashion and art during these pivotal years not only through the masterworks by Impressionists but also with paintings by fashion portraitists Jean B\u00e9raud, Carolus-Duran, Alfred Stevens, and James Tissot. Period costumes such as men\u2019s suits, robes de promenade, day dresses, and ball gowns, along with fashion plates, photographs, and popular prints offer a firsthand look at the apparel these artists used to convey their modernity as well as that of their subjects. Further enriching the display are fabrics and accessories\u2014lace, silks, velvets, and satins found in hats, parasols, gloves, and shoes\u2014recreating the sensory experience that made fashion an industry favorite and a serious subject among painters, writers, poets, and the popular press.\n\nTruly bringing the exhibition to life are the vivid connections between the most up-to-the-minute fashions and the painted transformations of the same styles. Pairing life-size figure paintings by Monet, Renoir, or Tissot with the contemporary outfits that inspired them, the show invites inquiry into the difference between portrait and genre painting, between Tissot\u2019s painted fashion plates and Manet\u2019s images of life experienced, demonstrating for the first time the means by which the Impressionists \u201cfashioned\u201d their models\u2014and paintings\u2014for larger artistic goals.",

At the same time, it addresses emergent sociohistorical phenomena, especially the increase of tourism, which made the sea newly attractive to artists in the second half of the 19th century.",

  "title": "Provoke: Photography in Japan between Protest and Performance, 1960-1975",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The short-lived Tokyo magazine Provoke is now recognized as a major achievement in world photography of the last 50 years. Although it existed only for three issues and a mere nine months\u2014November 1968 through August 1969\u2014Provoke crystallized the best of progressive art photography and cultural criticism in Japan during the 1960s and early 1970s. The Provoke members\u2014Daid\u00f4 Moriyama, Takuma Nakahira, Takahiko Okada, Yutaka Takanashi, and K\u00f4ji Taki\u2014connected in their interests with the nationwide political protest movement, itself a terrific source for photography and photobooks in that time. Their work also dovetails with the rise of performance in Japanese fine art during the same years.\n\nThis exhibition is the first to provide a thorough history of the Provoke movement and to draw out the many connections between photography, political protest, and performance in postwar Japan. Suites of photographs and books by Nakahira, Takanashi, and Moriyama, the three main photographers of Provoke, anchor the show. Other important photographers with works on view include Sh\u00f4mei T\u00f4matsu, a mentor to many Provoke members; Eik\u00f4 Hosoe, the most internationally recognized photographer of the time; and Nobuyoshi Araki, who remains a popular and controversial figure today. An early happening by the Fluxus group Hi-Red Center; a street performance by actor and director Shuji Terayama; and a Conceptual Art series by K\u00f4ji Enokura and Jir\u00f4 Takamatsu bring the exhibition across disciplines and territories. Meanwhile, selections from a set of nearly 500 protest photographs and some 80 protest books represent vernacular creative work of the period.\n\nA major international traveling show, which has Chicago as its only North American venue, this exhibition is the first survey of postwar Japanese art to be organized at the Art Institute of Chicago and draws heavily on the the museum\u2019s collection\u2014more than 60% of the over 200 items on display belong to the Art Institute.",

  "title": "Light Years: Conceptual Art and the Photograph, 1964-1977",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "From the mid-1960s, at a time when photography was commonly kept separate from the fine arts, a variety of artists associated with the nascent Conceptual Art movement began making and exhibiting photographic works as an integral contribution to debates about avant-garde painting and sculpture. Within a few years, their efforts had brought photography definitively into the mainstream of contemporary art.\nConceptual Art questioned habitual expectations of a work of art\u2014for example, that it should be singular and self-contained, or that it should emanate from an indescribable authorial sensibility. Uses of photography in the movement went hand in hand with an emphasis on art as information and on the roles played by spectators, critics, museums, and market values in validating the status of a work as art.\nConceptual photography also brought a new range of expression to progressive art, from humor to political critique, grounded in the mimicry of vernacular and commercial photographic genres. In exploring these areas, Conceptual artists helped to redefine the relationship of fine art to the broad public sphere of image creation and consumption.\nConceptual photography took many forms\u2014from photo-canvases and mixed-media sculptures to photobooks, magazine articles, slide and film projections, and postcards, as well as \"straight\" photographic prints shown singly or in series. It is this diversity of objects and presentation methods, rather than any fixed, categorical notion of photography or art in general, that is the lasting legacy of Conceptual Art: the establishment of contemporary art as a field without a medium.\nAs befits the presentation of this innovative exhibition, a special opening event occurred on Friday, December 9. Beginning at 6:00 p.m., the Art Institute projected Andy Warhol's 1964 film Empire\u2014a single, eight-hour-long nighttime take of the Empire State Building\u2014from the museum's Bluhm Family Terrace across Millennium Park to the upper stories of the Aon Center. Warhol's work thus set the stage for the artists featured in Light Years, who redrew the boundaries of both photography and contemporary art.",
