  "description": "This exhibition showcases archival items linked to 8 women who were made significant contributions to the Art Institute, or who had a lifelong association with the museum or school. Three curators (Bessie Bennett, Katharine Kuh and Christa Mayer Thurman), three donors (Kate Buckingham, Annie Swan Coburn and Margaret Day Blake), one teacher/author (Helen Gardner) and one artist (Georgia O\u2019Keeffe) put their stamp on this institution, often without much fanfare or public recognition. Bessie Bennettt was the first female curator in a major museum in the United States, Helen Gardner wrote with her \u201cArt Through The Ages\u201d the first comprehensive art historical handbook, Annie Swan Coburn enriched the museum\u2019s permanent collection with a fabulous gift of first rate Impressionist paintings. Each of these women has a story to tell, of dedication, hardship, perseverance and success.",

  "title": "Tools of the Trade: 19th- and 20th- Century Architectural Trade Catalogs",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Trade literature - also known as trade, manufacturers\u2019 or commercial catalogs - has been an indispensable tool of the architecture and design profession ever since its popularization in the late 19th century. The earliest precursors to modern trade literature emerged from European publishers and merchants in the 15th and 17th centuries though, given the degree to which the United States would come to dominate this field, it may arguably be Benjamin Franklin\u2019s book, fireplace and stove catalogs of 1744 to which the legacy is rightfully owed.\nCreated by merchants and manufacturers to promote their products and services, these publications were among the most widespread forms of early American advertising. Technological advances of the Industrial Revolution combined with modernization following the Civil War brought advances in printing technology that both reduced production costs and improved the quality of printed materials, the latter of which made the publication of primarily visual materials more viable.\nAmerica\u2019s westward expansion, fueled by the Homestead Act of 1862 and the growth of railroads, set the stage for the introduction of what was to be become the first mass-distributed trade literature: the mail order catalog. By appealing to rural consumers who wanted the selection and pricing of the big city while offering \u201csatisfaction guaranteed or your money back,\u201d Montgomery Ward tapped into a growing market that by 1897 was already generating nearly $7 million in annual sales.\nArchitectural building materials were commonly marketed in trade catalogs as early as the 1850s in such publications as \u201cPorter\u2019s Stone Dressing Machine\u201d (New York, 1855) and the Buffalo Iron Eagle Works catalog of 1854. Beginning around the turn of the century, companies such as Sears Roebuck, Aladdin, Hodgson and many others started selling \u201ckit houses\u201d: inexpensive, customizable mail order houses shipped straight from the factory for assembly either by the new homeowner or a local contractor. Over 200,000 were sold before falling out of favor in the early 1940s. Similarly, businesses such as the William A. Radford Company (see item #1) sold catalogs of well-crafted building plans at various levels of affordability for families and entrepreneurs wishing to build an attractive structure without having to pay an architect's commission.\nDespite their ephemeral nature, trade catalogs remain an important primary resource for the study of historical design and construction practices, and trends in both industry and culture.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "To herald the opening of the Modern Wing, the Department of Prints and Drawings will celebrate its extensive holdings of works on paper with an exhibition highlighting its modern and contemporary collection of drawings. Presenting approximately 80 works that, due to their inherent sensitivity to light, are rarely exhibited in public galleries, the exhibition shows artists\u2019 evolving use of drawing, from highly finished works of art to notational and diagrammatic sheets.\nThe exhibition begins with a display of the department\u2019s rich early modern collection. Highlights include works by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, as well as German School artists such as Max Beckmann and Ernst Kirchner. A selection of Dada and Surrealist drawings will be shown alongside ephemera and artists\u2019 books from the Ryerson Library\u2019s prized Mary Reynolds Collection. Next, works of postwar artists including Willem de Kooning and Lee Krasner demonstrate how American painters expanded the vocabularies of their European precursors. The exhibition concludes with the work of artists who matured after 1960. Iconic drawings by Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein will be joined by selections from the museum\u2019s broad holdings of works on paper by Felix Gonzalez-Torres and Martin Kippenberger.\nAdditionally, the exhibition presents many pieces new to the collection. Recently acquired drawings by Minimalists such as Robert Mangold, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Robert Ryman, and Richard Tuttle make their debut, as do works such as Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s Alka Seltzer, a stunning image that the artist never repeated in another medium. Also highlighted are freshly conserved works, including an exquisite example of a Purist drawing by Le Corbusier that shows the architect at his best as an artist.\nDisplaying major works by many of the artists that will be featured in the permanent galleries of the Modern Wing, this exhibition showcases the Art Institute\u2019s long-held commitment to collecting and exhibiting the art of our time.",

  "description": "A longstanding anchor of the curriculum, printmaking at the School of the Art Institute (SAIC) has been greatly enriched by the museum\u2019s collection and exhibitions, which have fostered the collaboration of print media with painting, photography, and other studio endeavors. This exhibition takes a look at an explosive period in Chicago printmaking when GIs returning from World War II swelled the SAIC\u2019s enrollment and increased demand to work with print media. Featured are works by artists who studied at SAIC and/or made Chicago their home base.\nAn SAIC alumnus, Vera Berdich was introduced to printmaking through the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. In 1947, Berdich became the etching instructor at SAIC and substantially expanded both the facilities and program in intaglio (etching and its related processes including mezzotint and drypoint). For over 30 years, she worked in intaglio and explored other techniques, especially non-silver photographic techniques such as clich\u00e9 verre and gum bichromate printing. One gallery of the exhibition is devoted to a progression of her rich intaglio plate, Pool of Tears, with state, trial, and color proofs shown together.\nThe work of Berdich\u2019s student and assistant, Philip Hanson, a noted painter and current professor at SAIC, will also be on view. During his period with Berdich, Hanson developed a sophisticated body of etchings, some recently acquired by the Art Institute. Produced concurrently with paintings on similar themes, these etchings reflect an array of Hanson\u2019s interests from Chicago icons and Baroque stagecraft to comic books and lessons learned from his scrutiny of Picasso\u2019s planar development of forms in space.\nAlso on display will be prints by H. C. (Cliff) Westermann, one of the foremost artists to study at SAIC after World War II and well-known for the economy of line\u2014nuanced yet brash\u2014in both his drawings and lithographs. Highlighted is Westermann\u2019s portfolio See America First, which captured the spirit of mid-century America\u2019s culture and landscape as he and his wife Joanna Beall traveled between the coasts in a restored pick-up truck that also served as their home. His distinctive body of work continues to influence young artists and enthusiasts who encounter it for the first time.\nTogether these complex works showcase the historical vitality of SAIC and the city as a crucial breeding ground for printmaking innovation.",

These practical guides for builders, primarily carpenters, were the important resources for construction techniques and design details, descendants in a long history of published manuals. Particularly in England the guides disseminated the designs of the 16th century Italian architect Andrea Palladio and largely shaped the architecture in the American colonies. They consistently emphasized the five orders\u2014Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite\u2014and classical details. By the mid-18th century many of the earliest manuals in the colonies were imported from Britain; later, select British titles appeared in American editions",

  "description": "The Ryerson and Burnham Libraries have been collecting ephemera\u2014objects that, as one dictionary definition puts it, \u201clast but a day\u201d\u2014for more than one hundred years, focusing particularly on art-related pieces such as postcards, artist statements, and exhibition announcements. The latter comprises the bulk of this display. In years past, galleries routinely mailed announcements to a long list of interested parties in order to advertise an exhibition and its opening. Despite being designed for transience, some of these objects are artworks in themselves. This exhibit celebrates a recent substantial gift of books and art ephemera from Terry R. Myers, an art critic, independent curator, and former Chair of Painting and Drawing at the School of the Art Institute.",

  "title": "Modern in America: Works on Paper, 1900-1950s",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "To celebrate the long-awaited release of American Modernism at the Art Institute of Chicago: From World War I to 1955, a scholarly catalogue showcasing the Art Institute\u2019s expansive permanent collection of American art, the Department of Prints and Drawings has organized this companion exhibition. Approximately 140 prints, drawings, collages, and watercolors from the permanent collection offer the opportunity to ruminate on what constituted \u201cmodern\u201d at various moments during the first half of the 20th century.\nRanging from Edward Hopper\u2019s watercolors of streetwalkers, painted in 1906, to Willem de Kooning\u2019s black enamel drip drawing of 1950, Modern in America showcases the wide variety of media and subject matter explored by American artists as they sought to respond to the compelling issues of their generations. Iconic images such as George Wesley Bellows\u2019s lithograph A Stag at Sharkey\u2019s and Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s rich pastel White Shell with Red\u2014true touchstones of American art\u2014stand in contrast to 30 rarely seen working drawings by Peter Blume for his famous painting The Rock, also in the Art Institute\u2019s collection.\nWorking on paper often provided artists with an affordable and direct way of responding to and mirroring their experiences. Starkly powerful lithographs of the 1930s, together with Jacob Lawrence\u2019s dynamic gouache paintings, demonstrate how works on paper could be both topical and intensely personal. Images of the modern city by Stuart Davis, Reginald Marsh, and Charles Sheeler offer public and private perspectives on the urban experience, while landscapes of rural America by Grant Wood and Walter Ellison suggest the tension between modern stylistic concerns and traditional subject matter.\nPrints and drawings also reveal how American artists responded to their encounters with European Modernism. The wave of interest in formal abstraction in the wake of the Armory Show of 1913 was followed by the distillation of natural forms by artists such as Rockwell Kent, Arthur Dove, O\u2019Keeffe, and Marsden Hartley. Modern in America also considers the influential contributions of European-born American artists such as Arshile Gorky, Yves Tanguy, and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy and of Mexican artists who worked extensively in the United States, including Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros.",

  "title": "Art and Appetite: American Painting, Culture, and Cuisine",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Elegant arrangements of cookies or cakes, lavish and overflowing arrays of fruits, or the remnants of a gluttonous feast\u2014depictions of food in art certainly convey a passion for culinary delights. Yet, still-life paintings of edibles also speak volumes about their cultural context. American artists have used food to both celebrate and critique their developing society; express ideas relating to politics, race, class, gender, and commerce; and investigate American identity. This exhibition brings together over 100 paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts from the 18th through the 20th century, along with a selection of period cookbooks, menus, trade cards, and posters, to explore the art and culture of food and examine the many meanings and interpretations of eating in America. \n\nFrom the earliest years of the United States, American artists such as Raphaelle Peale used still-life painting to express cultural, political, and social values, elevating the genre to a significant aesthetic language. In antebellum America, depictions of food highlighted abundance and increasing wealth. Elegant decanters of wine and spirits in still-life paintings by John F. Francis reflect the prevalence of drinking and the mid-century debates over temperance. During the Gilded Age, despite the implications of the term, American artists moved away from excess and eschewed high Victorian opulence in favor of painting the simple meal. Many artists, such as William Harnett or De Scott Evans, also used food pictures to serve up biting political commentary that addressed the social and economic changes of the 1880s and 1890s. \n\nIn the 20th century new ways of eating and socializing began to change depictions of food in art. Restaurant dining\u2014still novel in the United States in the late 19th century\u2014became a common subject in the works of William Glackens, John Sloan, and others. Caf\u00e9 and cocktail culture became increasingly important, described in the work of Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy, even as Prohibition banned the consumption of alcohol. \n\nFinally, during the 1950s and 1960s, Pop artists Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg addressed the ways in which mass production and consumption dramatically altered the American experience of food. Hamburgers, fries, and cakes were painted as objects of mass-produced comestibles without human referent. Artists employed new means to express their distance from the tangible reality of food, the visual power of advertising, the standardization of American meals from factory-produced products, and the gluttony of American appetites. \n\nToday as professional and home chefs increasingly turn toward local, organic food and American society ponders its history as a fast-food nation, this exhibition on the historical art of eating allows viewers to look at depictions of American food and culture with new meaning and fresh eyes.",

However, as tastes evolved, technologies shifted, and appeals for progress rang loud, we lost many pieces of greatness that embodied Chicago's history and architectural heritage. With Chicago: Lost & Found we pay tribute to some of the city's lost structures (some well-known icons, but mostly lesser-known gems) and celebrate a handful of reused buildings by exploring the vast archival collection at the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries. The cases are divided according to building type (entertainment, civic, industrial, hotels, and residential), reason for demolition (transportation changes), and reused structures and allow these historic buildings to tell their story once again.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The beloved decorating tradition is back, with several of the Thorne Rooms once again getting their seasonal trimmings. Among the most elaborate is the English Drawing Room of the Victorian Period, the only room with a Christmas tree. Now a ubiquitous feature of the season, the Christmas tree, or tannenbaum, was only brought to England from Germany in 1840 with the marriage of Prince Albert to Queen Victoria. The Thorne Room tree and accoutrements are based on a famous engraving of the royal couple and their children surrounding a trimmed and toy-bedecked tree, an image that would forever popularize this holiday fixture. Other ornamented rooms include:\n\nThe English Great Hall of the Tudor period with a wassailing bowl, yule log, and an essential part of the costuming for that period\u2019s singing and dancing revelers\u2014a mummer\u2019s mask\nThe Virginia Entrance Hall with mistletoe, wreath, and garland\nThe French Provincial Bedroom with shoes, orsabots, lined up before the fireplace, a cr\u00e8che, and puzzle\nThe modern-era California Hallway with an Otto Natzler mid-century menorah and box with a dreidel\nThe New Orleans, New Mexico, and the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) rooms filled with regional treats of the season\nThe 1930s French Library with a tiny taste of Art Deco holiday glamour\nThe traditional Chinese interior filled with shadow puppets and instruments that would have been used to celebrate the Chinese New Year as well as other festive occasions",

  "title": "Islamic Art at the Art Institute: A Century of Exhibitions and Acquisitions",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Since 1892, more than sixty exhibitions related to Islamic art have been held at the Art Institute of Chicago. Some of the earliest shows were organized by Arthur Upham Pope, who worked in various capacities for the Department of Asian Art during the first part of the 20th century. Pope, a noted American art historian, is credited with being one of the first scholars to introduce Persian art to the American public. Later, Charles Fabens Kelly and Donald Jenkins curated several important exhibitions, most notably the immensely popular Antique Oriental Rugs in 1947 and Near Eastern Art In Chicago Collections in 1974. \n\nThis exhibition in the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries' Franke Reading Room displays some of the finest 18th- and 19th-century antiquarian books on Islamic art and culture by prominent travelers to the Middle East and North Africa such as Sir John Chardin (1643\u20131713), James Justinian Morier (1782\u20131849), and Frederic Shoberl (1775\u20131853). Also displayed, and especially noteworthy, are the jewel-encrusted masterpiece prints by French artist Jean Baptiste Vanmour (1671\u20131737) depicting traditional garments from different countries of the region as well as intriguing archival documents, ephemera, and photographs related to past exhibitions and important acquisitions by the Art Institute.\n \nNote: This exhibition is not open during weekends.",

  "description": "The artistic practices of numerous cultures and eras are represented within the collections of the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries. Among the Libraries' holdings is a group of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century folio volumes on the decorative arts. These exquisite, large-format books comprise a range of cultural and historical styles of ornamentation and design, lavishly illustrated through both the written word and vividly rendered imagery. Various forms of decorative art are depicted in these volumes including illuminations, metalwork and jewelry, architectural ornamentation, costume and tapestry design, mosaics, pottery, furniture design, and glasswork. The illustrations employ printing techniques such as chromolithography, wood engraving, photogravure, and pochoir. The bindings themselves are an additional vehicle for the depiction of ornamentation, resulting in splendidly decorated books. \n\nUnfortunately, some of these volumes, most among the Libraries' earliest acquisitions, possess inherent condition problems associated with books from that period, compromising their usability. The paper is often in poor condition, the binding materials weakened and leather deteriorated. Additionally, the size and weight of these large format books contribute to their instability. In 2009, with the support of the Art Institute of Chicago's Auxiliary Board, the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries' Conservation Department embarked upon a project to conserve and stabilize this group of approximately six hundred folios on the decorative arts. This exhibition showcases a selection of the treasures uncovered during the project, and features some of the more complex conservation treatments performed.",

  "title": "Abelardo Morell: The Universe Next Door",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Over the course of the past 25 years, Cuban-born American artist Abelardo Morell has become internationally renowned for works that employ the language of photography to explore visual surprise and wonder. This exhibition of over 100 works made from 1986 to the present is the first retrospective of Morell\u2019s photographs in 15 years. Showing a range of works and series\u2014including many newer color photographs never exhibited before\u2014the exhibition reveals how this persistently creative artist has returned to a photographic vocabulary as a source of great inspiration.\n\nMorell came with his family to the United States as a teenager in 1962. He received a scholarship to attend Bowdoin College in Maine, where he first took a photography course; he later completed an MFA in photography at Yale University, looking to street photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Frank as models. After the birth of his son in 1986, he began making large-format pictures around his home, examining common household objects with childlike curiosity. As a professor at Massachusetts College of Art and Design, he experimented with optics in his teaching and initiated a series in which he turned an entire room into a camera obscura, photographing the projection of the outside world juxtaposed onto the surfaces of the room\u2019s interior.\n\nThese twin poles\u2014examining objects and images with fresh vision and exploring simple optics in myriad forms\u2014have been consistent orientation points for the many series that have since followed. Morell has turned his camera on conveyors of cultural meaning such as books, maps, money, and museums in extensive series that explore the perception of images. He has experimented with techniques as varied as photograms, still-life tableaux, stop-motion studies, and most recently the tent camera\u2014a kind of portable camera obscura that throws the image of a landscape upon the ground\u2019s surface. Now, after decades of working exclusively in black and white, he has begun to embrace color, both returning to old themes and series to view them in a new spectrum and pioneering new ways to understand optical effects, nature, and picture making. Showcasing his ever-inventive practice, this retrospective traces Morell\u2019s innovative career as he continues to mine the essential strangeness and complexity of images.",

  "title": "Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and the Portrait Print",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In the last decade of his life, acclaimed painter Anthony van Dyck (1599\u20131641) began a printmaking project that would change the conventions of portraiture: the Iconography. This art history\u2013changing series of over 100 portrait prints radically depicted artists on par with the most significant monarchs, diplomats, and scholars of the day. Presenting several etchings from the Iconography\u2014on view for the first time in nearly 90 years\u2014together with works by various artists from the 16th through the 20th century, this exhibition examines Van Dyck\u2019s lasting influence on the evolution of the portrait print and its significance as a distinct genre.\nThough already celebrated internationally for his work as a painter, Van Dyck contributed directly to the Iconography series, producing 15 etchings with his own hands. In many other cases, printmaking specialists and collaborators such as Lucas Vorsterman (1595\u20131675) and Paulus Pontius (1603\u201358) realized prints for the series based on Van Dyck\u2019s drawn or painted designs. The Art Institute of Chicago is fortunate to own all of the etchings that Van Dyck made along with several prints from the series designed by the artist and produced by his hired printmakers. Despite the significance of these etchings to Van Dyck\u2019s career and their importance to the history of portraiture\u2014and indeed to the history of printmaking\u2014these works have not been exhibited publicly at the Art Institute since they first entered the collection in 1929, and their impact on the broader field of the portrait print has not yet been fully examined.\nComprising approximately 140 works, including selected subjects from Van Dyck\u2019s Iconography, this exhibition features prints from five centuries. The earliest works, by artists such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471\u20131528) and Hendrick Goltzius (1558\u20131617), precede Van Dyck\u2019s career, while portraits by Rembrandt van Rijn (1606\u201369) and Jan Lievens (1607\u201374), artists who followed Van Dyck, demonstrate his immediate influence. Continuing to follow Van Dyck\u2019s impact on the genre are works by artists such as Francisco de Goya (1746\u20131828), Edgar Degas (1834\u20131917), K\u00e4the Kollwitz (1867\u20131945), and Chuck Close (born 1940). Adding to the presentation is a gallery that explores the political role of the portrait print as well as one devoted to portraits created in various media during the 17th century\u2014drawings, painted miniatures, wax and marble sculptures, and paintings of an intimate scale\u2014all highlighting the unique qualities of the portrait print.\nA full-color publication of approximately 112 pages accompanies this exhibition.\n \nSupport for Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and the Portrait Print is generously provided by Alan Templeton and Prince Charitable Trusts.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Rigorously purged of descriptive detail and sharply composed, the works Matisse produced between late 1913 and 1917 are among his most demanding, experimental, and enigmatic. While these works have typically been seen as unrelated responses to the influences of Cubism and World War I, this exhibition illustrates the deep connections between them and their critical role in an ambitious, cohesive project of developing what Matisse called \u201cthe methods of modern construction\u201d\u2014a process in which the act of creation itself was the main focus.\nUnlike his earlier art, which was characterized by rich color and arabesque line, these new paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings are often rigorously abstracted, heavily reworked, and dominated by black and gray. Canvases typically show a multitude of paint layers and a nearly sculptural approach to scraping and incising; sculptures display a remarkable emphasis on geometry and structure; prints reflect and reinform the incising and scraping that the artist devised for his paintings; and drawings are frequently composed of a network of erasures and stumping, and elegant, spare line.\nMatisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917 explores how Matisse developed his own version of Modernism, one work after the next, during the most ambitious, unbridled, and radically inventive period of his long career.",

  "title": "What May Come: The Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular and the Mexican Political Print",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The most influential and enduring progressive printmaking collective of its time, the Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular (the Popular Graphic Art Workshop or TGP) created some of the most memorable images in mid-century printmaking. This Mexico City\u2013based workshop took up the legacy of the famous Mexican broadside illustrator Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada, creating prints, posters, and illustrated publications that were popular, affordable, legible, politically topical, and, above all, formally compelling. This exhibition includes over 100 works from the Art Institute\u2019s rich holdings\u2014one of the most significant TGP collections in the United States\u2014demonstrating why this collective boasted such international influence and inspired the establishment of print collectives around the world.\nFounded in 1937 by Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez, Luis Arenal, and American-born Pablo O\u2019Higgins, the TGP emerged and evolved in the crucible of antifascist and leftist politics in Mexico in the period surrounding World War II. This milieu shaped not only the workshop\u2019s dedication to a collective printmaking model but also its production aimed at both \u201cthe people\u201d and discerning collectors, a strategy necessitated by the era\u2019s quickly changing political tides. The collective created works for groups spanning the leftist and progressive political spectrum, including the government of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and his successors, the Mexican Communist Party, major trade unions, and antifascist organizations.\nDuring the TGP\u2019s heyday, from its founding until the 1950s, the workshop produced thousands of prints, primarily linocuts and lithographs, for everything from ephemeral handbills and newspapers to political and advertising posters to luxe portfolios and printed books. Favoring an expressive, realist visual language, its work addressed a wide range of socially engaged themes, including Mexican history and culture, political satires both local and international (including calavera broadsides), rural and urban scenes of daily life, and agitprop prints. The members of the workshop, a core of about 40 during its height, produced both individual and collective works and welcomed numbers of foreign members and guest artists\u2014from Elizabeth Catlett to Josef Albers\u2014to use the workshop in order to collaborate on prints and create individual pieces.\nShowcasing the TGP\u2019s prolific and varied output, What May Come is organized into thematic sections such as Chicago connections to the TGP, antifascism, national history, daily life, caricature, and popular visual traditions. A Spanish-English catalogue accompanies the exhibition, which also features bilingual labeling.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "When Alexander the Great seized Egypt on his mission to conquer the Persian Empire in 332 B.C., he was one in a long line of Greeks who were dazzled by Egypt and its ancient culture. The legendary Greek historian Herodotus had remarked in the fifth century B.C., \u201cthis country has more marvels and monuments that defy description than any other,\u201d and indeed those \u201cmarvels and monuments\u201d had been drawing Greeks to Egypt for centuries\u2014as tourists, traders, diplomats, and soldiers. Despite this cultural contact, the art and architecture of the Egyptian kingdom had retained its distinct style, uninfluenced by its frequent visitors. In fact, Egypt\u2019s unique art forms had persisted for more than 3,000 years! \n\nWhen Ptolemy, one of Alexander\u2019s generals, came to rule Egypt, he found it wise to adapt to the older culture. He installed himself as \u201cpharaoh,\u201d built a new capital at Alexandria, and united the two major gods of each nation to form a new universal deity, Zeus Amon. The era of Ptolemy\u2019s dynasty is known as the Ptolemaic Period, acknowledging the 300-year Greek rule that began with Alexander the Great and ended with the suicide of Queen Cleopatra in 30 B.C. It was an age of profound curiosity and rich experimentation, as the Greeks, and later the Romans, met an established culture far older than their own and exchanged artistic, social, and religious ideas with the ancient civilization. \n\nThis exhibition explores this confluence of cultures through over 75 artworks. Gilded mummy masks, luxury glass, magical amulets, and portraits in stone and precious metals, demonstrate the integration of foreign styles while also paying tribute to the enduring legacy of ancient Egypt\u2019s distinctive visual culture.",

  "title": "DEAD TIME",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "At the center of Cally Spooner\u2019s DEAD TIME is a 63-page score of the same title, which consists of drawings, photos, captions of her recent work, and fan mail, both borrowed and self-authored. The score is hosted on the front of a 49-foot-long wall, whose smooth surface is typical of a contemporary art gallery. Yet the rear of the wall is raw and unfinished, like a vacant backstage.\n \nEach day this wall becomes the scenography for a live performance of the score, enacted by living, prerecorded, and inanimate elements. These include a dancer who attempts to repair her body and prolong time; an actor who strives for anatomical perfection only to stagnate; and a narrator who ruminates on failing nervous systems, financial centers, and a celebrity under attack because of #MeToo shame. Disembodied voices call out \u201cMother\u201d repeatedly, while Ivanka Trump narrates her capacity to \u201carchitect\u201d her life, work, and children. Alongside, there is the sound of the dancer, sniffling and gasping, as she\u2019s suffering from a head cold. A cellist plays to the tune of shame, repeating a Netflix theme song, and a stainless-steel drinking fountain runs perpetually. Disconnected from a public water line and recirculating its own supply of overly chlorinated, poisonous water, the fountain is cleaning itself to death. Each of these elements, drawn out from the score, occurs in the gallery according to its own duration, repertoire, and speed. Once a day, for an hour, all the elements collide.\n \nAt once an installation, an instruction, and a live performance, DEAD TIME takes its name from the cinematic technique temps morts (lit. \u201cdead time\u201d), in which the camera is left running to film unplanned and unscripted occurrences. These seemingly \u201cdead\u201d moments may, in fact, be brimming with life. Living and nonliving elements overlap, dancers collapse into inertia, repetitive and monotonous sounds penetrate the space, overlooked details become legible, scenes are inactive and empty, yet captivating. Here, hidden and disavowed temporalities arrive, providing an alternative to how neoliberalism and corporate capitalism aim to manage, monetize, and control all life, which DEAD TIME as a whole reflects on, stages, and resists.",

  "description": "During the 1960s and 1970s artists' periodicals began to proliferate in the cultural landscape. The relatively inexpensive modes of production and easily accessible medium provided artists the opportunity to reach their audiences directly, removing the mediation of curators, gallerists, and critics. In this sense, these periodicals acted as alternative exhibition spaces; offering artists the freedom to explore their artistic practice in new and often profound ways. This exhibition highlights some examples of artists' periodicals produced from the 1960s to the present. Unlike most art or art-related journals, these periodicals seek to function as art rather than pure scholarship or documentation of art history, yet they still function as both\u2014in a unique manner.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The comics of Chicago artist Chris Ware are widely regarded as some of the most important works in the history of the artform. Ware is known for employing a unique visual language engineered specifically for the way the human mind inherently processes pictures in sequence into something understood as narrative. His meticulously constructed comics depict the adverse lives of his characters often set amongst a backdrop of Midwestern urban architectural design from the last century. Many of the buildings Ware employs in his artwork are revered Chicago architectural spaces that no longer exist and share a quality of hardship and unfortunate circumstance with the characters that dwell within. His depictions return life and emotional energy to these lost buildings, transforming them from setting to the subject.\nThis exhibition draws from the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries\u2019 rich archive of architectural photographs, ephemera, drawings, and artifacts that Ware has looked to for inspiration and source material, alongside drawings from Ware\u2019s comic stories. Starting chronologically with Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth, a passage of which takes place during the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition of 1893 until his latest work Building Stories, which tells the story of a young woman renting a room in a quintessential brownstone row house in a rapidly gentrifying west-side Chicago neighborhood.",

  "description": "Concurrent with Moholy-Nagy: Future Present, this exhibition, which features books on artists, highlights experimental photography's collaborations with light and time, and the simultaneous generosity and violence of the sun.\n\nCommencing with a reproduction of H. Fox Talbot's six-installment publication The Pencil of Nature, this exhibition emanates from his definition of photographs as \"photogenic drawings\" generously \"impressed by the agency of Light alone,\" an interpretation that draws attention to the indexicality and medium-specificity of photography and its fundamental qualities: light and time.\n\nFeaturing books and periodicals on experimental photographers Chris McCaw and Charles Ross, who both collaborate with the sun, encouraging a concentration of the sun's light and heat through lenses to burn marks into film and wood, respectively, evidencing the sun's destructive capabilities and its ability to author its own marks.\n\nTwo editions of Kikuji Kawada's The Map document the violent \"black stain\" effect of the \"intense sunlight of Hiroshima\" produced by the Atomic Bomb.

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Every year, thousands of visitors\u2014young and old, newcomers and long-time members\u2014are captivated by the Thorne Miniature Rooms. The 68 period rooms built on a scale of one inch to one foot have something for everyone\u2014a visual history of architecture and decorative arts, the astounding workmanship of thousands of tiny accessories, and memories of childhood dollhouses. But this year, the rooms will prove even more delightful, donning new period-appropriate decorations for the season\u2014a new holiday tradition.\n\nAs with any grand holiday project, planning for this ornamentation began very early, soon after last year\u2019s holidays had passed. The first step was to determine which rooms would be adorned, with extensive research done on the history of holiday festivities and decorations. While perhaps surprising given today\u2019s over-the-top decorations that cover every shop, city, and suburb, identifying eras that participated in major ornamentations was more difficult than expected. Many periods were rather spare in their festive trimmings, and some, in fact, banned the celebration of Christmas entirely.\n\nEventually six rooms with the most significant and visual holiday celebrations were chosen to inaugurate this new Thorne Rooms tradition. Among the most elaborate is the English Drawing Room of the Victorian Period, the only room with a Christmas tree. Now a ubiquitous feature of the season, the Christmas tree or tannenbaum, was only brought to England from Germany in 1840 with the marriage of Prince Albert to Queen Victoria. The Thorne Room tree and accoutrements are based on a famous engraving of the royal couple and their children surrounding a trimmed and toy-bedecked tree, an image that would forever popularize this holiday fixture. Other ornamented rooms include the English Great Hall of the Tudor period with a wassailing bowl, yule log, and an essential part of the costuming for that period\u2019s singing-dancing revelers\u2014a mummer\u2019s mask; the Virginia Entrance Hall with mistletoe, wreath, and garland; the French Provincial Bedroom with shoes, or sabots, lined up before the fireplace, a cr\u00e8che, and puzzle; and the modern-era California Hallway with an Otto Natzler mid-century menorah and box with a dreidel.\n\nKeeping to Mrs. Thorne\u2019s exacting standards of craftsmanship, several renowned artists from across the country and around the world were engaged to create pieces for the rooms. Tiny toys have arrived from Germany, diminutive delicacies from Italy, and petite plants from South Africa, while several pieces were made in-house by the rooms\u2019 caregiver of the last several years, Lindsay Mican Morgan.\n\nStep back into holidays of yore when the freshly decorated rooms are unveiled November 1 and come back to see a surprise addition later in the season.",

One of the very few and finest examples of such a work outside of Naples, the cr\u00e8che is an intricate Nativity scene that reflects the vitality and artisanship that the city is still known for. The Art Institute\u2019s cr\u00e8che features over 200 figures\u2014including no less than 50 animals and 41 items of food and drink\u2014all staged in a spectacular Baroque cabinet with a painted backdrop.

During the 18th century, the period from which most of the figures of the Art Institute\u2019s cr\u00e8che date, these relatively simple tableaux underwent a transformation into highly dramatic and theatrical renderings. Traditional sacred elements of Nativity scenes\u2014the Holy Family, wise men, angels, and shepherds\u2014were combined with profane aspects not of Bethlehem but of contemporary Neapolitan life\u2014rowdy tavern scenes and bustling street activities\u2014in dazzling displays of artistic techniques. Churches, wealthy citizens, members of the nobility, and the royal family all competed to commission the most complex presentations of this popular art form from leading artists and artisans, the same people who were creating monumental sculptures and altars for churches and palaces. These artists rendered figures in oil-painted terracotta to achieve the most realistic expressions in cr\u00e8ches and constructed painstakingly detailed costumes of luxurious fabrics that mimicked the fashions of the time. The Art Institute\u2019s cr\u00e8che represents the pinnacle of this artistic practice, born of the centuries-old tradition of Nativity scenes yet bursting with the energy of 18th-century Neapolitan life.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre\nJuly 16\u2013October 10, 2005\nRegenstein Hall\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864\u20131901), one of the most popular and important painters of late-19th-century Paris, has not been the subject of a major exhibition since the large retrospective presented in London and Paris in 1991 and 1992. The National Gallery of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago have collaborated to organize Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre, an exhibition that places the artist's work at the peak of his career between 1888 and 1896 in conjunction with the work of other artists of the period. Toulouse-Lautrec and his contemporaries produced images that evocatively record the social geography of Montmartre, Paris' center of licit and illicit entertainment. Taking Montmartre as a state of mind as well as an environment, the exhibition reevaluates the decadent worldview of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris. The focus is on several Montmartre establishments, including dance halls, the circus, and maisons closes (a French euphemism for brothels), and the installation integrates major avant-garde paintings, topographical canvases, and posters and caricatures of stars such as Aristide Bruant and Lo\u00efe Fuller.\n\nThe aim of the exhibition is to place Toulouse-Lautrec in a wider cultural context and to include for comparison and contrast a selection of works by his contemporaries\u2014including painters, printmakers, and poster artists\u2014to evoke the life and art of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Montmartre. This supporting cast includes such famous names as Degas, Van Gogh, and Picasso, but also less well-known artists such as Anquetin, Steinlen, and Casas, who also captured the spirit of the age. The inclusion of these works adds a new dimension to our understanding of Toulouse-Lautrec and his time.\n\n\nCATALOGUE\nThe exhibition catalogue, Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre, is available in the Museum Shop. Hardcover, $60; softcover, $40. Click here for more information.\n\n\nORGANIZERS\nThis exhibition was organized by the Art Institute of Chicago and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\n\nCURATORS\nGuest curator for Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre is professor Richard Thomson, University of Edinburgh, a leading scholar of Toulouse-Lautrec and fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris and curator of the 1991\u201392 retrospective. Organizing curator for the Washington D.C. venue is Philip Conisbee, senior curator of European paintings at the National Gallery of Art. In Chicago, organizing curators are Douglas Druick, Searle Curator of European Painting and Prince Trust Curator of Prints and Drawings, and Gloria Groom, David and Mary Winton Green Curator of Medieval through Modern European Painting and Modern European Sculpture, and Mary Weaver Chapin, former Mellon Curatorial Fellow.\n\n\nOTHER VENUES\nToulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre was presented at the National Gallery of Art from March 20 to June 12, 2005, and is on view at the Art Institute of Chicago from July 16 to October 10, 2005.\n\n\nSPONSORS\nThe Sara Lee Foundation is the exclusive corporate sponsor of Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Emerging from decades of civil war and struggles to defend its own territory, France was on the move in the years around 1500, led first by Charles VIII and then by his cousin Louis XII, each king in turn marrying Anne, the spirited young duchess of Brittany. Through an extraordinary range of rare and precious objects, this exhibition tells the story of art in this dynamic period\u2014an exuberant mixture of spiritual and secular work, the union of traditional late Gothic form and a new antique vocabulary, and the combination of the many symbols of the French monarchy with the latest trends imported from Milan, Genoa, and Naples, cities that French forces occupied in this period. A rich and varied panorama of this transitional moment is illustrated through tapestries, stained glass, goldsmithwork, monumental sculpture, painted portraits and altarpieces, and intimate illuminated manuscripts. The diverse offerings include a witty stained-glass roundel designed by court painter Jean Fouquet depicting two maidens holding the initials of Laurens Girard for the home of this courtier, one of the king's treasurers. The luminous Nativity by Jean Hey, known as the Master of Moulins, is also on display, a commission from Cardinal Jean Rolin, bishop of Autun in Burgundy, as an epitaph near his grave. The cardinal's favorite lapdog accompanies him as he kneels in perpetual prayer before the vulnerable, newborn Christ Child. And the poetic The Madonna of the Yarnwinder by Leonardo da Vinci and his assistants exemplifies how the French kings and leading courtiers sought from Italy marble, sculptors, and paintings in the latest fashion to decorate their castles and monuments.",

  "description": "Known for his commitment to socially progressive design in large-scale residential and institutional projects, Goldberg's distinctive work often juxtaposed fluid, organic shapes against the rectilinear forms popularized after World War II. His work can be seen in such noted buildings as Marina City and River City in Chicago, and in hospitals across the United States. This exhibition examines the full breadth of Goldberg's career\u2014from his early work in prefabrication, through the leisure projects of the 1950s, to the skyscrapers of the 1980s\u2014all bound together by his belief in architecture's obligation to improve the state of the human condition and the conviction that urbanism was the best avenue to that end.",

  "description": "Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium from Greek Collections presents 63 superb artworks from the early Christian and Byzantine eras in the Mary and Michael Jaharis Galleries of Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Art. Originally exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the exhibition represents major artistic holdings from Greece\u2014many of which have never been exhibited outside that country\u2014consisting of shimmering mosaics, architectural fragments, manuscripts, luxury glass, silver, personal adornments, liturgical textiles, and painted icons. The Art Institute\u2019s display offers a selection of exceptional works from the original exhibition, including the debut of the 14th-century Icon of Saint Prokopios.\n\nFor over 1,000 years, Greece was part of the vast Byzantine Empire, established in 330 A.D. by the emperor Constantine, who moved the capital of the Roman Empire eastwards to a small town named Byzantium in modern-day Turkey. Renamed and transformed into Constantinople, Byzantium would later lend its name to an empire of splendor and power that endured for more than a millennium. Greek replaced Latin as the language of the empire, and Greece itself was home to important centers of theology, scholarship, and artistic production. Heaven and Earth explores the rich legacy of the Byzantine Empire through five main themes: the transition from the Classical to the Byzantine world, spiritual life, intellectual life, the pleasures of life, and crosscurrents between East and West during the final days of the empire in the 15th century.",

  "title": "The Artist and the Poet",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Planned to coincide with the Art Institute\u2019s major exhibition Picasso and Chicago this presentation from the Department of Prints and Drawings is inspired by the modern master's love of poetry\u2014Picasso was close friends with poets, including Max Jacob, Guillaume Apollinaire, Andr\u00e9 Breton, and Paul \u00c9luard, and collaborated with them from his earliest days in Paris. Taking Picasso's passion as a jumping-off point, this collection of works on paper surveys the myriad ways visual artists have been inspired by or collaborated with poets in the 20th century.\nThe exhibition begins with a selection of sheets from Robert Motherwell\u2019s A la Pintura (1968\u201372) and David Hockney\u2019s The Blue Guitar (1976\u201377), prints series inspired respectively by the poetry of Rafael Alberti and Wallace Stevens\u2014who was himself inspired by Picasso. The presentation continues with an exploration of the various working relationships between the artist and poet. Sometimes they are one and the same, such as Chicago\u2019s own, Tony Fitzpatrick. Sometimes they work in tandem or tangentially to illustrate a text, as in the portfolios by Ken Price and Alex Katz. And sometimes artists independently co-opt the words of another; Lesley Dill, for instance, uses the words of Emily Dickinson in compositions such as A Word Made Flesh (1994).\n \nAlso on display are the publications of Tatyana Grosman and her workshop Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), where poets have long played an important role\u2014as employees, muses, and collaborators. An early portfolio Stones (1957\u201359) exemplifies a collaborative relationship between the poet Frank O\u2019Hara and artist Larry Rivers, while Skin with O\u2019Hara Poem (1963\u201365), a print by Jasper Johns demonstrates O\u2019Hara\u2019s deeper impact on the artists who worked at ULAE. The word play of Edwin Schlossberg reveals how printing and materials impacts how one interprets text, and finally the series Fifth Stone, Sixth Stone (1967\u201368) by Lee Bontecou shows how the visual arts can likewise inspire the poet, in this case Tony Towle.\nOther galleries are devoted to the poetic inspiration of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, represented by the prints of Henri Matisse and Ellsworth Kelly, as well as the impact of Guillaume Apollinaire on Louis Marcoussis. Russian poetic sources ranging across the century are also included, interpreted in the visual works of Nathalija Gontcharova, Kazimir Malevich, and Robert Rauschenberg.",

  "description": "Throughout the 20th century to the present, artists have found both clever and practical methods of questioning the idea of authorship and authenticity in the production of an art object. Artists have continually reenvisioned their own involvement in artistic production by utilizing a variety of strategies, such as outsourcing labor to studio assistants or skilled craftspeople, making artwork under pseudonyms, providing instructional parameters for ephemeral installations, and co-opting other artists' artwork as a material base for use in new works. Stemming from early conceptual practices and moving toward high-production studio models developed by contemporary artists, this exhibition showcases images and texts that elucidate the methods, work, and studio practices of artists including Francis Al\u00ffs, John Baldessari, Vern Blosum, Marcel Duchamp, Gaylen Gerber, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Sol LeWitt, Martin Kippenberger, Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, Stephen Prina, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, and Christopher Williams.",

  "title": "Modern Inkers: Experimentation in Comics",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "During the course of the last century comics have steadily evolved from the works of the early innovators to the many contemporary creators who continue to rethink and reshape the medium. Today, when many gallery and museum exhibitions worldwide are focusing on the work of comics artists, it becomes unmistakable that the definition of comics has expanded to include much more than just traditional graphic novels, superhero tales, and Sunday funnies; they now can also function as an avenue for visual experimentation and as a mode of self-expression. The works from the collection on display begin with the newspaper comics of the early 1900s, which combined spirited narratives with polychromatic frontiers in the works of Lyonel Feininger.\nAlso present is a selection of underground comics of the 1960s, which proved that artists taking an active role in printing and promoting their own books was not only a practical way to distribute the material and have complete creative control, but also circumvented the restrictive laws that accused comics of corrupting America's youth. Many of the contemporary artists in this exhibition have also taken publishing into their own hands, creating multi-color serigraph editions which bear more a resemblance to artists' books than to something you would normally find in a comic shop. The work by many of the artists here has clearly influenced works of Expressionism, Surrealism, Pop, and Contemporary Art. The Ryerson and Burnham Libraries actively have been growing our collection of comic art, including the work of many young creators who currently live and work in Chicago.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In 1425 Lorenzo Ghiberti was commissioned to design a pair of bronze doors for Florence's Baptistery. He labored on the task for 27 years, fashioning a masterpiece that Michelangelo called \"truly worthy to be the Gates of Paradise\" for its remarkable beauty and grandeur. For the past 25 years, Ghiberti's gates have undergone extensive conservation, which is now nearing completion. To celebrate the conclusion of this arduous project, three relief panels from the Gates of Paradise and sections of the doors' frieze have traveled to North America. This exhibition affords viewers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe Ghiberti's work up close before the individual elements are reintegrated with the rest of the doorframe and put on permanent display in a hermetically sealed room in the museum of the Florence Cathedral (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo), never to travel again.\n\nDepicting the stories of Adam and Eve, Jacob and Esau, and David and Goliath, the panels offer viewers a coherent vision of Ghiberti's artistic genius and the range of perspectival solutions he invented for his narrative panels. This exhibition also reveals the complex nature of the conservation process through the juxtaposition of two sections of the frieze and two decorative heads: one version of each has been resplendently cleaned; the other is still disfigured by damaging surface deposits. A video documents the conservation methods used, including cutting-edge laser technology, which enables the surface dirt to be cleaned in a non-invasive manner.\n\nSculptor, painter, draftsman, architectural consultant, stained-glass designer, entrepreneur, author of a treatise on the arts, and the first artist to write an autobiography, Ghiberti could honestly declare in his Commentaries that \"few things of importance were made in our city that were not designed or devised by my hand.\" The masterpieces in this exhibition, while representing only a small portion of his works, confirm that Ghiberti had good reason to boast.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "After its widely popular debut last year, our spectacular 18th-century Neapolitan cr\u00e8che returns this holiday season enhanced with newly acquired figures. One of the very few and finest examples of such a work outside of Naples, the cr\u00e8che is an intricate Nativity scene that reflects the vitality and artisanship that the city is still known for. The Art Institute\u2019s cr\u00e8che features over 200 figures\u2014including no less than 50 animals and 41 items of food and drink\u2014all staged in a spectacular Baroque cabinet with a painted backdrop. Elaborate, complex, and wondrous, the Neapolitan cr\u00e8che is a rare example of the genre and a once-in-a-lifetime acquisition for the Art Institute.\n\nSacred imagery reenacting the Nativity has its roots in fourth-century Rome but by the 13th and 14th centuries, in part due to its association with St. Francis of Assisi, such scenes had become a permanent feature of Neapolitan churches. During the 18th century, the period from which most of the figures of the Art Institute\u2019s cr\u00e8che date, these relatively simple tableaux underwent a transformation into highly dramatic and theatrical renderings. Traditional sacred elements of Nativity scenes\u2014the Holy Family, wise men, angels, and shepherds\u2014were combined with profane aspects not of Bethlehem but of contemporary Neapolitan life\u2014rowdy tavern scenes and bustling street activities\u2014in dazzling displays of artistic techniques. Churches, wealthy citizens, members of the nobility, and the royal family all competed to commission the most complex presentations of this popular art form from leading artists and artisans, the same people who were creating monumental sculptures and altars for churches and palaces. These artists rendered figures in oil-painted terracotta to achieve the most realistic expressions in cr\u00e8ches and constructed painstakingly detailed costumes of luxurious fabrics that mimicked the fashions of the time. The Art Institute\u2019s cr\u00e8che represents the pinnacle of this artistic practice, born of the centuries-old tradition of Nativity scenes yet bursting with the energy of 18th-century Neapolitan life.\n\nDue to the fragility of the original silk costumes and exquisite embroidery, the Neapolitan cr\u00e8che can only be on view for a few weeks every year. Don\u2019t miss your chance to revel in Baroque artistry this season!",

  "description": "Vivian Suter\nel bosque interior\n\nAugust 25, 2018 \u2013 January 27, 2019\nKen and Anne Griffin Court\n\n\nVivian Suter (Argentinian-Swiss, born 1949) installs her large-scale abstract paintings as immersive interiors that mirror the exterior of her home: the Guatemalan rainforest. For the past 30 years, Suter has lived and worked in a remote studio on a former coffee plantation in Panajachel, Guatemala, over 100 miles from Guatemala City. Much like the porous architecture of the Central American rainforest, Suter\u2019s colorful paintings on untreated canvases are exposed to the rainforest, absorbing elements of the environment along the way. Monsoons, hurricanes, bright equatorial sun, and plant and animal life leave their marks on the paintings and contribute to the generative life of the work. \n\nSuter explains her method of painting as a profoundly sensory experience: \u201cI allow my consciousness to permeate the moment of painting, enabling all of my senses to simultaneously influence the canvas in front me: how I feel about myself and others; the noises of the village in the distance; my natural surroundings, light, temperature, sun, rain, and trees all intermingle to inspire me. The seasons highly affect my paintings. At the moment, it is rain season in Guatemala, so my work is impacted by the rainfall and thunderstorms. I use the rain water to wet my pigments, oils, acrylics, and fish glue, and the mud finds its way onto the canvases.\u201d\n\nSuter embraces the inevitability of her work\u2019s natural decay, underscoring the cycles of life of which they are a part and, ultimately, their mortality as organic structures. Her approach to the installation of her work expands from the ecology of its production. While each painting retains its independence, the works are closely associated, together forming an ecosystem of related parts. For el bosque interior, a suite of existing paintings populate the Modern Wing\u2019s Griffin Court, alongside a selection of new paintings produced by the artist and configured in response to the space. This assemblage creates an interior in which the various elements are at once autonomous and congruent, harmonious and dissonant\u2014similar to the life that is invoked in and through these works. \n\nExhibition curator Hendrik Folkerts, Dittmer Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art , highlights this aspect of the installation: \u201cVivian Suter\u2019s work fully inhabits the interior of Griffin Court and brings the life that is at the core of these magnificent paintings into the heart of the Art Institute of Chicago.\u201d  \n\n\nel bosque interior is curated by Hendrik Folkerts (Dittmer Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art), with the support of Mary Coyne (Research Associate, Contemporary Art).\n\nSponsors:",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The American city of the 1960s and 1970s experienced seismic physical changes and social transformations, from urban decay and political protests to massive highways that threatened vibrant neighborhoods. Nowhere was this sense of crisis more evident than in the country\u2019s three largest cities: New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Yet in this climate of uncertainty and upheaval, the streets and neighborhoods of these cities offered places where a host of different actors\u2014photographers, artists, filmmakers, planners, and activists\u2014could transform these conditions of crisis into opportunities for civic discourse and creative expression.\n\nThe City Lost and Found is the first exhibition to explore this seminal period through the emergence of new photographic and cinematic practices that reached from the art world to the pages of Life magazine. Instead of aerial views and sweeping panoramas, photographers and filmmakers turned to in-depth studies of streets, pedestrian life, neighborhoods, and seminal urban events, like Bruce Davidson\u2019s two-year study of a single block in Harlem, East 100th Street (1966\u201368). These new forms of photography offered the public a complex image of urban life and experience while also allowing architects, planners, and journalists to imagine and propose new futures for American cities.\n\nDrawn from the Art Institute\u2019s holdings, as well as from more than 30 collections across the United States, this exhibition brings together a large range of media, from slideshows and planning documents to photo collage and artist books. The City Lost and Found showcases important bodies of work by renowned photographers and photojournalists such as Thomas Struth, Martha Rosler, and Barton Silverman, along with artists known for their profound connections to place, such as Romare Bearden in New York and ASCO in Los Angeles. In addition, projects like artist Allan Kaprow\u2019s Chicago happening, Moving, and architect Shadrach Wood\u2019s hybrid plan for SoHo demonstrate how photography and film were used in unconventional ways to make critical statements about the stakes of urban change. Blurring traditional boundaries between artists, activists, planners, and journalists, The City Lost and Found offers an unprecedented opportunity to experience the deep interconnections between art practices and the political, social, and geographic realities of American cities in the 1960s and 1970s.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "This show, which included ninety original paintings, was the first major travelling exhibition of the original, large-scale watercolors John James Audubon painted for The Birds of America. After beginning with static depictions of birds in profile, in the style of eighteenth-century naturalists, Audubon began to depict birds in motion and experiment with a variety of media, including watercolor, gouache, and oil. In his mature works, he often combined many techniques and media for a single image: graphite strokes on wings to lend iridescence or blended pastel that suggested the soft texture of feathers. The exhibition also examined the engraving and hand coloring undertaken by Robert Havell, Jr. and his assistants to turn Audubon\u2019s immense watercolors (life-sized, even for large birds) into prints. The exhibition traced this process through a sequence showing an engraved copperplate, uncolored and unfinished prints, and a complete bound volume of the \u201cDouble Elephant\u201d folio of The Birds of America, so named for its exceptional size. In addition to the Art Institute of Chicago, this exhibition was on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Memphis Beooks Museum of Art, the New-York Historical Society, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.",

The two artists wrote often to one another, friends, and relatives. Van Gogh's most frequent correspondent was his brother Theo, an art dealer in Paris in the late 1880s. The quotations reveal that both men were avid chroniclers of the subjects they painted: peasants, townspeople, landscapes, and houses. The painters' candid remarks about their own canvases, most of which had either just been completed or were still in progress, offer unique perspectives on the Arles period. They also refer to a number of works painted before and after the artists' time togethe",

By the time they met in the autumn of 1887, both men were well into their thirties (Gauguin 39, van Gogh 34), and each had several failed careers behind him.",

  "title": "Josef Koudelka: Nationality Doubtful",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Czech-born French artist Josef Koudelka belongs in the firmament of classic photographers working today. Honored with the French Prix Nadar (1978), the Hasselblad Prize (1992), and the International Center of Photography Infinity Award (2004), Koudelka is also a leading member of the world-renowned photo agency Magnum. This exhibition, his first retrospective in the United States since 1988, is also the first museum show ever to emphasize his original vintage prints, period books, magazines, and significant unpublished materials.\n\nKoudelka became famous in anonymity through the worldwide publication of his daring photographs of the Soviet-led invasion of Prague in August 1968. Just 30 years old at the time, Koudelka had already worked for a decade, principally on Gypsies, for which he visited Roma populations for weeks at a time in his home country and later abroad over the course of years. This ambitious series beautifully combines a sense of modern history with timeless humanism.\n\nChoosing exile to avoid reprisals for his Invasion photographs, Koudelka traveled throughout Europe during the 1970s and 1980s, camping at village festivals from spring through fall and then printing in wintertime. His photographs of those decades became the series Exiles. Since the late 1980s Koudelka has made panoramic landscape photographs in areas massively shaped by industry, territorial conflict, or\u2014in the case of the Mediterranean rim\u2014the persistence of Classical civilization.\n\nTracing this long and impressive career, this exhibition draws on Koudelka\u2019s extensive holdings of his own work and on recent major acquisitions by the Art Institute, including the complete surviving contents of the debut presentation of Gypsies in 1967 (22 photographs), as well as ten Invasion images printed by the photographer just weeks after the event. Also on display are early experimental and theater photographs and some of the photographer\u2019s beautifully produced books\u2014which stretch dozens of feet when unfolded. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition, which after its debut at the Art Institute travels to the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, and Fundaci\u00f3n MAPFRE, Madrid.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "H\u00e9lio Oiticica (1937\u201380) is arguably the most influential Latin American artist of the post\u2013World War II period and is recognized for his significant contributions to the development of contemporary art. A relentless innovator always pushing the traditional boundaries of art, Oiticica moved rapidly and radically from early works influenced by European modernism to large-scale installations that were meant to be physically experienced and often to critique political and social issues. This exhibition offers the first retrospective in the United States of the Brazilian artist\u2019s groundbreaking and influential achievements.\n\nDemonstrating the great breadth of the artist\u2019s work, the exhibition begins with the adventurously elegant works on paper from early in Oiticica\u2019s career (1955\u201358).  These progressively dynamic compositions paved the way for his works that liberated painting from a flat plane. By 1959, Oiticica\u2019s painterly-sculptural Spatial Reliefs and Nuclei broke free of the wall and entered the space of the viewer. The Nuclei, composed of panels suspended from the ceiling, created areas through which the viewer could walk. His later installations continued to revolutionize the role of the viewer, as they responded to the increasingly oppressive political situation in Brazil under the military dictatorship. Oiticica\u2019s most famous work, Tropic\u00e1lia (1967) brings together a series of clich\u00e9s associated with tropicalness\u2014sand, gravel, exotic birds, and lush foliage\u2014which was contrasted with a television monitor that emits continuous images and sounds. Tropic\u00e1lia, a name subsequently borrowed by the musician Caetano Veloso for his anthem against Brazil\u2019s dictatorship, became a powerful movement in all the arts\u2014a political position both against the right\u2019s conservatism and the left\u2019s desire for a purely Brazilian art.\n\nThroughout his brief but energetic career, Oiticica seamlessly melded formal and social concerns in his art, seeking to be internationally relevant and, at the same time, specifically Brazilian. Above all, he aimed to communicate to his audiences the deep pleasure and satisfaction inherent in creative work. That aim reached fruition as his career advanced and his art took on an increasingly immersive nature, transforming the viewer from a spectator to an active participant or \u201cparticipator.\u201d This exhibition is the first anywhere to treat these later works in depth, acknowledging Oiticica\u2019s New York years (1971\u201378) and his return to Brazil (1978\u201380) as discrete periods within his career. In addition to viewing the original works on display, visitors will be invited to take off their shoes and walk through sand-filled installations, view Amazonian parrots, and try on exhibition copies of Oiticica\u2019s Parangol\u00e9s, objects he created to be carried or worn and among the artist\u2019s most radical contributions to contemporary art.\n\nA fully illustrated catalogue covering the artist\u2019s entire career in essays by authors from the United States and Latin America accompanies the exhibition.",

  "description": "Special tickets are not required for this exhibition. \n\nCharles Sheeler: Across Media\nOctober 7, 2006\u2013January 7, 2007\nRegenstein Hall\n\nCharles Sheeler (1883\u20131965) is recognized as one of the founders of American modernism and one of the master photographers of the twentieth century. His work is synonymous with precisionism, a crisp, clean, hard-edged style that reconciled cubist abstraction and the machine aesthetic of Marcel Duchamp with American subject matter. Trained in industrial drawing, decorative painting, and applied art at the School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia, and having studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Sheeler fully absorbed the lessons of each discipline and forged his own singular approach. \n\nEqually gifted as a photographer and painter, Sheeler analyzed the relationships between photography and traditional artistic methods such as painting and drawing with more rigor and intellectual discipline than perhaps any other American artist of his generation. Like a well-conceived scientific experiment, his practice of using fully realized photographs explicitly as the basis for paintings and drawings led to results that crystallized both the differences and similarities between them. The brilliance and scope of Sheeler\u2019s approach is evident in the way his works in one medium often manage to function as autonomous objects while being inextricably linked to works in other media.\n\nCharles Sheeler: Across Media is the first exhibition to focus upon the complex, often paradoxical relationships between photography, film, drawing, and painting that were central to Sheeler\u2019s art. A celebration of the formal clarity and beauty of the artist\u2019s works, this exhibition draws upon a core of 50 masterpieces, including the magnificent painting Classic Landscape (1931), masterful drawings such as New York (1920) and Counterpoint (1949), and striking examples of the artist\u2019s photographs. The works in this exhibition display Sheeler\u2019s fascination with the visual effects of various media, evident not only in his photographs but also in his works created after them in other media. \n\n\nCATALOGUE\nThe beautifully illustrated catalogue features detailed analyses of Sheeler\u2019s various media and methods and offers new interpretations of critical periods in the artist\u2019s career. The exhibition catalogue is available in the Museum Shop, call 1-800-518-4214.\n\n\nORGANIZERS AND SPONSORS\nThis exhibition is organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\nThis exhibition is made possible through generous support from the Terra Foundation for American Art. \n\nThe exhibition catalogue and brochure were developed by Charles Brock, Assistant Curator of American and British Paintings, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\n\nCURATOR\nSarah E. Kelly, Henry and Gilda Buchbinder Associate Curator of American Art, Art Institute of Chicago\n\n\nOTHER VENUES\nNational Gallery of Art, Washington: May 7\u2013August 27, 2006\nFine Arts Museums of San Francisco, M.H. de Young Memorial Museum: February 10\u2013May 6, 2007",

  "description": "It was 1913 when the International Exhibition of Modern Art (more popularly known as the Armory Show) came to the Art Institute of Chicago. The museum was acquiring old masters and plaster copies of classical sculpture. Lorado Taft's Fountain of the Great Lakes was erected on the south side of the building that year. This traveling exhibition introduced many Chicagoans to avant-garde movements and artists such as Picasso, Brancusi, Gauguin, and Matisse. In Chicago, the Armory Show competed with a juried watercolor show, the annual Flower Show, and conservative scenes of domesticity as painted by Pauline Palmer and Frederick Frieseke and had a profound effect on many collectors and donors who helped build the museum's collection of modern art.\nThis year marks the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show at the Art Institute, and the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries provide visitors a glimpse into the past with an exhibition of archival documents including photographs, press coverage, accounting ledgers, and correspondence regarding the Armory Show.",

  "title": "Rarely Seen Contemporary Works on Paper",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Whether centuries old or the latest contemporary creations, works on paper are extremely light sensitive and can only be displayed in the galleries for short and infrequent periods of time before they must be returned to the safety of the dark, climate-controlled vault. Some of these works, however, also make brief appearances in the Prints and Drawings Study Room, frequently requested by professors for their classes to view as exemplars of specific techniques. This exhibition brings together nearly 100 of these highly popular contemporary works on paper, many of which have not been seen in our galleries in years (or ever), offering visitors an intriguing look at how this rich collection is used pedagogically.\nWhile tools and artistic methods are often privileged over historical significance or connoisseurship in these educational sessions, the exhibition offers abundant examples by artists whose works on paper were celebrated in their time and continue to influence subsequent generations. Harlem Renaissance artist Romare Bearden\u2019s iconic collage, The Return of Odysseus (Homage to Pintoricchio and Benin), makes a rare and welcome appearance, given that it is not often exhibited due to its fugitive materials\u2014cut and pasted papers, graphite, and touches of black and gray wash. Also included are multiple works by Carroll Dunham, Martin Kippenberger, and Ed Ruscha, some being exhibited for the first time in Chicago. In addition, curators from the Ryerson Library have selected post\u2013World War II comics publications by artists whose careers and aesthetic interests are related and sometimes influential to the other artists on view. Shown in this context are drawings informed by the conventions of graphic narratives, slapstick humor, and prescient social commentary.\nAlso on view are drawings by Chicago-based artists such as Julia Fish, who has a particular affinity for working on paper. Over the years, she has created drawings that not only extend her painting ideas but also exist as separate, self-contained bodies of work. Always focused on her immediate environment, Fish creates drawings based on memory and observations of the conditions surrounding her garden, as well as the properties of her house. She employs media specifically to evoke, rather than mimic, physicality, weight, touch, and time. Also a professor of art at the University of Illinois-Chicago, Fish is a frequent visitor to the Prints and Drawings Study Room herself and uses our diverse collection in part to teach students in the techniques demonstrated in this exhibition.",

Until the early 16th-century, about a third of the gold production in Europe came from Hungary, where artists were exposed to the styles of the major European capitals and those of the Ottoman east. The catalogue that accompanied the exhibition was the first major English-language work on Hungarian gold and silver.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Epic and luminous, the work of Jeff Wall has overturned nearly every convention of photography. Meticulously staged and theatrical in scale, Wall\u2019s images have more in common with the grandest history painting of the 18th century and the flickering mesmerism of cinema than with the fleeting, documentary style of much of modern photography. Forty-one works of the Vancouver-based artist, who pioneered the use of the light box as a vehicle for displaying photographs, are included in this major retrospective exhibition, previously installed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. \n\nThe size and scale of the works in Jeff Wall, measuring on average 6 feet by 8 feet, are testaments to the ambitions of permanence the artist brings to photography\u2014as grand as monumental painting of the past three centuries, painstakingly staged and constructed, and digitally combined and altered. Wall\u2019s vision and use of photography represent a bold step forward in the reconsideration of this medium as a fine art, equal in stature to painting and sculpture, rather than relegated to a separate sphere of technically driven image-making. Jeff Wall is a rare opportunity to see works produced over nearly three decades, allowing viewers to not only enjoy the dazzling images themselves but to also experience the evolution and development of an artist's career.",

  "title": "Playing with Pictures: The Art of Victorian Photocollage",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "During the Victorian era, photography became remarkably popular and accessible, as people posed for studio portraits and exchanged these pictures on a vast scale. The makers of the collages shown here cut up these portraits and placed them in elaborate watercolor designs in albums. With their sharp wit, absurd senses of humor, and dramatic shifts of scale akin to those Alice experienced in Wonderland, these photocollages stand the rather serious conventions of photography in the 1860s and 1870s on their heads, debunking stuffy Victorian clich\u00e9s with surreal, subversive, and funny images. Oftentimes, the combination of photographic portraits with painted settings inspired dreamlike and even bizarre results: placing human heads on animal bodies; situating people in imaginary landscapes; and morphing faces into common household objects. Such images reveal the educated minds as well as accomplished hands of their makers, as they take on new theories of evolution, the changing role of photography, and the strict boundaries of aristocratic society. Together they provide a fascinating window into the creative possibilities of photography in the Victorian era and enduring inspiration for photographic experimentation today.\nPlaying with Pictures showcases the best of these albums and loose pages from collections across the United States, Europe, and Australia; 40 pages are shown in frames on the wall, while 11 separate albums are displayed in cases, accompanied by \u201cvirtual albums\u201d on computer monitors for visitor interaction. One of the highlights of the exhibition is an exciting addition to the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection: the Madame B Album, a fascinating album of more than 140 pages of photographs and watercolor designs, which was acquired in 2005 and is on public display for the first time. \u201cMadame B\u201d has been identified as Blanche Fournier, the wife of a French diplomat. In her clever, whimsical, and surreal world, photographic portraits dot the tail feathers of a turkey, faces decorate the wings of a colorful butterfly, and a secret language of flowers communicates hidden meanings.",
  "short_description": "Collage is commonly thought of as a modern art form, but the act of \u201cplaying with pictures\u201d has a long, rich, and surprising history. Sixty years ahead of the avant-garde\u2014and more than a century before Photoshop\u2014aristocratic Victorian women were already experimenting with photocollage. This world-premiere exhibition is the first to comprehensively examine this little-known phenomenon, presenting many eye-opening works that have rarely\u2014and in many cases never\u2014before been displayed or reproduced.",

  "description": "In the 1930s, photographers pushed the genre of documentary photography to the forefront of public culture in the United States and onto the walls of newly opened museums and art galleries. That historic development receives new insight with this exhibition focusing exclusively on the work of American photographers Berenice Abbott, Walker Evans, and Margaret Bourke-White.\n\nPhotographic activity flourished in America in the 1930s during the Great Depression, and the genre of documentary emerged as a mode of understanding contemporary events. While the world was in a turbulent state\u2014national and international economies were being severely tested, political systems were in flux, and Europe was preparing again for war\u2014Americans recognized their own viable cultural heritage and sought to record and expand that heritage. Indeed, the country\u2019s literary, artistic, and architectural traditions were fortified in the period\u2019s explosion of popular literature, the founding of new art museums, and the establishment of New Deal government-funded arts programs.\n\nAt the same time, advances in technology, production, and distribution transformed mass media in this country: Americans enjoyed weekly picture magazines, radio broadcasts, and popular movies in unprecedented numbers. Photography played an especially critical role in contemporary culture, appearing in books, newspapers, and magazines as well as being accorded exhibitions in art museums and galleries. Photographs crossed the boundaries between public and private use, impersonal documentation and expressive creation, and popular visual culture and fine art.\n\nAmerican Modern examines the practice of documentary photography through the work of three of the most important photographers of the decade, each of whom contributed a fundamental, independent, and novel idea about documentary to the common pool of artistic practice. For Abbott, it was the notion that photography was a means of critical dialogue and communication. Evans thoroughly investigated the idea that photography has a unique and essential relationship to time. And Bourke-White\u2019s documentary practice fused the logic and pageantry of modern industry with the drama and individual narratives of its subjects.\n\nCatalogue\nA lavishly illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.\n\nSponsor\nThis exhibition is co-organized by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, Texas, and the Colby College Museum of Art in Waterville, Maine.\n\nThe exhibition and accompanying publication have been made possible in part by the National Endowment for the Arts, the Mr. and Mrs. Raymond J. Horowitz Foundation for the Arts, and the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation.\n\nSupport for the Chicago presentation of this exhibition is generously provided in part by the Terra Foundation for American Art.\n\nGenerous support is provided by members of the Exhibitions Trust: Goldman Sachs, Kenneth and Anne Griffin, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, Donna and Howard Stone, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Sullivan, and an anonymous donor.",

The exhibition emphasized Sargent's successful integration of Impressionism and portraiture, but also displayed the artist's early genre scenes and later Impressionist landscapes.",

  "description": "Voracious readers have often been called bookworms or even book-eaters. Indeed, whether offering food for thought or actual recipes, books and food have long enjoyed a close relationship. This focused exhibition of books, prints, and drawings from Europe and America ranges from the 15th to the 20th century and touches on numerous historical and literary inspirations. Examining food culture from many delicious angles, it delves into over- and under-indulgence in food and drink, presents depictions of the senses and curious appetites in print, finds humor in housekeeping, and demonstrates the fate of books with inks, glues, and paper tasty enough to attract real bookworms. Planned to coincide with the major Art Institute of Chicago exhibition Art and Appetite: American Painting, Culture, and Cuisine, Devouring Books draws on the culinary collections of the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries as well as select objects from the Department of Prints and Drawings.",

  "title": "Benin-Kings and Rituals: Court Arts from Nigeria",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The royal arts of the Benin Kingdom of south-central Nigeria affirm the centrality of the oba, or divine king, portraying his divine nature. While recording the kingdom\u2019s significant historical events and the oba's involvement with them, they also initiate the oba\u2019s interactions with the supernatural and honor his deified ancestors, forging a continuity that is vital to the kingdom\u2019s well-being.\nThe materials used in Benin\u2019s royal arts\u2014primarily brass, ivory, and coral\u2014are endowed with sacred power. The innate value of these materials within Benin and the time and skill that is invested in working them reflect the earthly and otherworldly influence of the oba and the great wealth of his kingdom. Benin\u2019s royal arts belong to a tradition that favors convention even as it promotes creativity and innovation, especially as a reflection of royal prerogative. Through time, rulers have used the arts to interpret the history of the kingdom and to orient themselves with the past in an effort to support their own initiatives and define their images for posterity.\nThrough these extraordinary works of art, the exhibition traces Benin\u2019s history\u2014from its origins in the 13th century to the arrival of Portuguese envoys in the 15th century to the growing wealth of the kingdom from coastal trade in the 16th century. It also looks at themes of kingship, hierarchy, and ritual within Benin\u2019s royal court. The exhibition closes by considering the reconfiguration of Benin\u2019s monarchy after the 1897 invasion by British forces and traces its arts following this course-altering event.",

  "title": "Focus: Richard Hawkins: Third Mind",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Since the early 1990\u2019s, Richard Hawkins has developed an emphatically diverse art practice that resists easy classification. Offering alternate histories through the juxtaposition of decidedly unlike elements\u2014whether ancient Greek and Roman sculpture, 19th-century French Decadent literature, post-structuralist theory, 1980s teen hearthhrobs, Native assimilation in the American Southeast, or the intricacies of Thai sex tourism\u2014the work is, at its core, about the pleasure of intense looking. Hawkins is an equal opportunity voyeur, but it is the male figure\u2014often young, beautiful, and exotic\u2014that is the subject and inspiration in his work. Bolstered by alternative historical precedents or influences and infused each time with new ways of seeing, he takes his subject well beyond personal indulgence into the realm of a deeply engaged rethinking of representation. Critical pairings are primal matter, making collage not simply a medium for Hawkins but a philosophy/methodology that defines his art. His earliest mature statements took the form of collage, and the medium has held firm within his oeuvre ever since. For this reason, Richard Hawkins: Third Mind\u2014the artist\u2019s first American museum survey\u2014is largely focused on his collage-based work as a platform from which to understand his larger practice.\n\nThe title, Third Mind, makes reference to Richard Hawkins: Of two minds simultaneously, the artist\u2019s 2007 exhibition at DeAppel in Amsterdam. The phrase \u201cof two minds\u201d typically means to be undecided, uncertain, or unsure. It is not indecision, however, that is at play in Hawkins\u2019s practice. Rather he is deliberate and indeed mindful in the \u201cduplicity and ambiguity\u201d that characterizes his work. In this way, Third Mind serves as a testament to the artist\u2019s continued propagation of \u201cminds,\u201d made up of a steady stream of thoughts, ideas, desires, fantasies, interactions, possibilities, viewpoints, opportunities, opinions, memories, and meanings. The title also invokes William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin\u2019s 1978 book, The Third Mind, which introduced the concept of the \u201ccut-up\u201d in literature. Inspired by the history of collage in the visual arts and a natural extension of Gysin\u2019s own visual collage practice, the cut-up becomes for the authors an alternative to the \u201ceither-or proposition\u201d and linear declarative sentence structure that \u201cshackles\u201d Western thought and linguistics. Just as Burroughs and Gysin had deconstructed narrative structure through their cut-ups, Hawkins continually reconstructs himself as an artist with a practice that is remarkably unified within constant yet fluid shifts over time and among genres, techniques, and mediums. Inherent to his work is an invitation to feel things at the extremities of human experience and an acknowledgment, even championing of difference, desire, and pleasure as productive ends in themselves.\n\nRichard Hawkins: Third Mind will consist of approximately 80 objects, including books, collages, drawings, paintings, and sculptures spanning his 20-year career. Installed in the Modern Wing\u2019s Abbott Galleries as well as the Ryerson Library, this focus exhibition highlights several major bodies of work with particular consideration of the collage medium as the central mode of Hawkins\u2019s practice.",

  "description": "This traveling exhibition of 65 bronze statuettes was selected from the collection of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum to provide a historical cross-section representing a centuries-long European collecting tradition. The works chosen for exhibition all had variants or counterparts in American museum collections. The exhibition opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art following its run at the Art Institute of Chicago. To supplement the show while it was in Chicago, Art Institute curator Ian Wardropper selected 80 examples of Renaissance decorative arts from Chicago collections to display, including a clock and reliquary that showcased some of the same techniques and ornament used in the bronze statuettes.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "These artists took from Gauguin the challenge to traditional easel painting, especially his notion that all art should be decorative. By making mural-like paintings and screens, they not only developed a new language for picture-making favoring large flat surfaces and allover design, they also returned art to its original function as decoration for a specific interior setting. In addition to at least five splendid folding screens, the exhibition includes and reunites paintings that, although once part of ensembles or series, have since been separated and dispersed into public and private collections. In some instances, the installation evokes the interior for which the works were originally conceived.",
  "short_description": "Beyond the Easel: Decorative Painting by Bonnard, Vuillard, Denis, and Roussel, 1890-1930 is an exhibition of unusually formatted and sometimes very large paintings and screens. Featuring 85 works from around the world, the exhibition explores the importance of decorative paintings from the 1890s to the early decades of the 20th century, focusing on the four artists most closely associated with the genre and also most successful with it; Pierre Bonnard, Edouard Vuillard, Maurice Denis, and Ker Xavier Roussel.",

  "description": "WALL TEXT\nThe entertainment industry exploded in late nineteenth-century Montmartre, a gritty neighborhood on the outskirts of Paris known for its flamboyant nightlife and bohemian atmosphere. Artists, performers, and ambitious entrepreneurs flocked there to capitalize on the cheap rent and lack of police oversight, and the crowds of Paris quickly followed to see the raucous performances at the new cabarets and dance halls. The spirited establishments of the quartier fed into a thriving culture of celebrity, where singers and dancers such as Jane Avril, Aristide Bruant, and May Milton\u2014all depicted in this gallery\u2014sought widespread notoriety and critical acclaim. \n\nPainter and printmaker Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec moved to Montmartre in 1882, and he dedicated his career to depicting the district\u2019s famous personalities, who were often his close friends. Using the relatively new advertising technique of large-scale posters, Lautrec regularly collaborated with performers, writers, and cabaret owners who wanted to distinguish themselves from their competitors. Lautrec\u2019s dynamic and recognizable images, displayed throughout the streets of Paris, quickly catapulted his clients to stardom. Instead of idealizing his subjects, he chose to celebrate their individuality by emphasizing their unique traits. In doing so, he was also able to promote his own cutting-edge artistic endeavors, which included experiments in color lithography, the use of unconventional techniques and materials, and a continued observation of modern life\u2019s cast of characters.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The School of the Art Institute (SAIC) and the Art Institute of Chicago museum have long shared a symbiotic relationship\u2014one institution training artists and the other establishing an encyclopedic collection of works of art for artists and the public alike to study and enjoy. Since the Art Institute\u2019s earliest days, students have enjoyed spending class time in the galleries and have found inspiration in the museum\u2019s collection. Today, the museum is fortunate to count a great deal of works by SAIC alumni among its holdings.\nTo celebrate the long association between the museum and the school, Homegrown features approximately 120 objects, primarily works on paper, from the Art Institute\u2019s collection made by artists who attended SAIC. Beginning with the early 20th century and organized by decade, the display presents works by some of the most illustrious SAIC-educated artists while also prominently featuring pieces by those whose tenure at the school has at times been overlooked. Highlights include 20 iconic self-portraits by Ivan Albright (1897\u20131983), created at the end his career using a variety of drawing and painting media, and a selection of color woodblock prints by Gustave Baumann (1881\u20131971), a Santa Fe\u2013based artist, designer, and letterpress printer who studied at SAIC as a teenager. Also included are the sketchbooks of Margo Hoff and LeRoy Neiman; Neiman\u2019s drawings of Chicago\u2019s Oak Street Beach, in particular, showcase the glitterati of a period typified by Hugh Hefner\u2019s founding of Playboy in the city in 1953. Pieces by the so-called Monster Roster artists who matured in the late-1940s and early 1950s\u2014including Cosmo Campoli, Leon Golub, and Nancy Spero\u2014and Imagist and Hairy Who artists such as Gladys Nilsson, Suellen Rocca, Sarah Canright, and Christina Ramberg, along with a variety of more recent works, round out the selections. Nilsson\u2019s Big School Picture; Little Paper Mural, commissioned by SAIC to be used as a poster advertising the school, serves as a particularly witty, beautiful example of the artist\u2019s work in its maturity.\nThat the school has produced such a range and wealth of talented artists over the years and that the museum has been able to acquire so much of this work to share are truly causes for celebration. The Art Institute of Chicago invites you to experience and explore the best of Chicago\u2019s very own\u2014works by artists \u201chomegrown\u201d here on Michigan Avenue.",

  "title": "Martin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "One of the most renowned artists working today, Martin Puryear is celebrated for his elegant but playful sculpture and his devotion to craft. Lesser known is the extensive iterative process of drawing and printmaking that is essential to the artist\u2019s studio practice. This exhibition is the first to draw back the curtain on that practice. Featuring over 100 drawings and prints as well as 12 sculptures\u2014many borrowed directly from the artist and never displayed before\u2014the presentation offers an unprecedented look into Puryear\u2019s inspirations, methods, and transformative process.\n\nMartin Puryear has had a long relationship with Chicago and the Art Institute. He lived in the city for 12 years, \u2028and the museum has long been supportive of his work\u2014acquiring key pieces in the 1980s, organizing an extensive survey in 1991, and conserving many of his fire-damaged early prints and drawings after that show. Puryear has responded in kind, giving the museum a double-sided drawing for his sculpture Sanctuary and participating \u2028generously and closely in the development of this exhibition, including loaning many works that he has never shared publicly before.\n\nUniting these rarely seen drawings, several sculptures, and selections from his sketchbooks, Martin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions traces the artist\u2019s career from his student days at Catholic University in the early 1960s through the present, with works created as recently as 2014. Critical to Puryear\u2019s development were his formative years spent with the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone (1964\u20131966), a period in which he was inspired by and gave expression to buildings, flora, insects, animals, and children\u2014the entirety of his environment. Since then, Puryear has returned to many of these themes, experimenting with scale, materials, and varying levels of abstraction. In the exhibition, visitors can witness \u2028this evolution of thought\u2014how a sketch of a house in Sierra Leone is transformed 10 years later into an abstracted proto-sculptural form, or how a head-like shape is reworked in bronze, wood, black Cont\u00e9 crayon, and graphite.\n\nBy bringing to life the artist\u2019s uncanny ability to make forms that are suggestive, playful, and transformative, all while remaining anchored in the world, this display of Puryear\u2019s explorations across visual ideas and media offers a 360-degree view of the creative process of a contemporary master.\n\nSponsors\n\nMartin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSupport for the exhibition is provided by the Morton International Exhibition Fund and the Kemper Educational and Charitable Fund.\n\nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v.S. Levy, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, Betsy Bergman Rosenfield and Andrew M. Rosenfield, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, and the Woman\u2019s Board.",

Plus, a new long-term loan, a miniature replica of a Pullman Observation Car that was exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, is unveiled for the first time.\n\nSeveral other rooms once again get their seasonal trimmings. Among the most elaborate is the English Drawing Room of the Victorian Period, the only room with a Christmas tree. Now a ubiquitous feature of the season, the Christmas tree or tannenbaum, was only brought to England from Germany in 1840 with the marriage of Prince Albert to Queen Victoria. The Thorne Room tree and accoutrements are based on a famous engraving of the royal couple and their children surrounding a trimmed and toy-bedecked tree, an image that would forever popularize this holiday fixture. Other ornamented rooms include:\n\nThe English Great Hall of the Tudor period with a wassailing bowl, yule log, and an essential part of the costuming for that period\u2019s singing-dancing revelers\u2014a mummer\u2019s mask\nThe Virginia Entrance Hall with mistletoe, wreath, and garland\nThe French Provincial Bedroom with shoes, or sabots, lined up before the fireplace, a cr\u00e8che, and puzzle\nThe modern-era California Hallway with an Otto Natzler mid-century menorah and box with a dreidel\nThe New Orleans, New Mexico, and the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) rooms filled with regional treats of the season\nThe 1930s French Library joins with a tiny taste of Art Deco holiday glamour",

  "title": "Harlequin",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Harlequin is one of the most recognizable and enduring figures of the Commedia dell'Arte, an improvised form of theater performed by masked actors that originated in the mid-16th century in northern Italy but soon spread to the streets and courts of Europe. Commedia dell'Arte troupes were especially popular at the French court, where their performances were enjoyed for nearly two centuries. These shows involved drama, comic skits, and acrobatic routines not necessarily linked to any one story. Stock characters were identified by specific masks, costumes, and accessories. Although these have changed little today, the personalities of the characters have evolved. Harlequin, for example, was originally an oafish but agile figure from the Italian region of Bergamo, whose poverty was symbolized by a costume of multicolored patches. By the late 18th century, he had developed into a quick-witted trickster. His diamond-patterned suit now referred to his physical agility and to his multifaceted nature, at once cunning and foolish, shrewd and absurd.\nThroughout the 19th century, Harlequin and other commedia figures like Polichinelle were regular features in popular entertainments in Paris, such as vaudeville \"harlequinades\" or inexpensive theatrical productions, puppet theaters, caf\u00e9-concerts, and ballets. Harlequin costumes, along with those of other commedia characters like Pierrot (a French addition to the original Italian cast), were available to regular Parisians, who donned them during Mardi Gras celebrations and for other masked balls.\nThis special exhibition, drawn from the Art Institute of Chicago's permanent collection, celebrates the extraordinary loan of Paul C\u00e9zanne's Harlequin from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The works on display by C\u00e9zanne, Edgar Degas, \u00e9douard Manet, and Pablo Picasso speak to the appeal of Harlequin and other commedia figures to avant-garde artists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.",

  "title": "Steve McQueen",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Steve McQueen is an internationally acclaimed artist whose work is primarily engaged with moving images. Born in London in 1969, he has, over the last twenty years, made a series of film and video installations designed for gallery-based presentation, along with two feature films made for cinematic release. His efforts in these two distinct, but interrelated, arenas have earned him a reputation as one of the most important and influential artists of his generation working with these media, and beyond. McQueen's earliest works are silent, and mostly black-and-white, often with a focus on the body, very often the artist\u2019s own. Subsequent pieces incorporate, as a general rule, sound and color, and often emerge from more elaborate investigations.\n\nMcQueen has been equally concerned with the act of recording moving images as he is with the specific conditions in which these images are presented. The size of the screen, the dimensions of the room, and the relationship between the viewer and the projection itself are all fundamental considerations. McQueen's thinking about formal and spatial relationships in this regard lends a sculptural element to his art. One work in particular, Queen and Country (2007\u201309), is an entirely sculptural installation with no moving image or sound component. Presented here for the first time outside of the United Kingdom, the work is a memorial to British men and women killed in military service during the most recent war in Iraq.\n\nMost of McQueen's oeuvre\u2014including his gallery-based installations as well as feature films\u2014evidences a potent, at times oblique, political consciousness. Many works address specific social and historical moments in ways that seemingly emerge from documentary or journalistic impulses. Other films are more abstract, their meanings shaped by allegory or metaphor. McQueen always communicates directly to viewers through what one writer termed \"the medium of aesthetic affect.\"",

  "description": "Drawn from the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries' archives, a selection of sketches from artists' and architects' papers offers insight into the travelers' personal experiences and their visual responses. The sketches were made to document delightful curiosities or pleasurable events to be recalled at a later time. For both the artist and the architect the act of sketching establishes a more permanent image in the mind and memory.\nIn Creation is a Patient Search (1960), Le Corbusier sums up the process: \"When one travels and works with visual things... one uses one's eyes and draws so as to fix deep down in one's experience what is seen. Once the impression has been recorded by the pencil, it stays for good, entered, registered, inscribed. The camera is a tool for idlers, who use a machine to do their seeing for them.\" (p. 37)",

  "title": "Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Modern Century",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The two most important developments in photography in the first half of the 20th century were the emergence of lasting artistic traditions and the rise of mass-circulation picture magazines. Henri Cartier-Bresson (1908\u20132004) was a leading figure in both domains. In the early 1930s, he helped to define photographic modernism, using a handheld camera to snatch beguiling images from fleeting moments of everyday life. After World War II, he turned to photojournalism, and the magic and mystery of his early work gave way to an equally uncanny clarity and completeness.\nBefore the dominance of television, most people saw the world through the eyes of picture magazines. Early in Cartier-Bresson\u2019s postwar career, his photographs of Gandhi\u2019s funeral and the Communist revolution in China were journalistic scoops. But the vast majority of his photographs describe everyday events, for his essential subject was society and culture\u2014civilization.\nCartier-Bresson began traveling at the age of 22. For nearly half a century, he was on the road most of the time, and the geographical range of his work is notoriously wide. Its historical range is just as broad\u2014from ancient patterns of preindustrial life to our contemporary era of ceaseless technological change. In the realm of photography, Cartier-Bresson\u2019s work presents a uniquely rich, far-reaching, and challenging account of the modern century.\nThis retrospective exhibition\u2014the first since the photographer\u2019s death in 2004\u2014draws extensively on the collection and generous cooperation of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris.\nAll works in this exhibition are by Henri Cartier-Bresson (French, 1908\u20132004) and are gelatin silver prints. All of the publications on view in vitrines are courtesy of The Museum of Modern Art, New York.",

  "title": "Master Drawings Unveiled: 25 Years of Major Acquisitions",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Chicago is renowned for its collections of master drawings both publicly and privately held. The Art Institute of Chicago has been collecting these works for over a century and has substantial world-class holdings\u2014particularly with regard to drawings of the French and Italian schools.\nThis exhibition highlights a selection of master drawings from the 17th to mid-20th century that have been purchased by the museum over the past 25 years but have not yet had occasion to be shown. Arranged chronologically, the selection opens with masterpieces of the French school dating from the 17th century through Neoclassicism. New representatives of Swiss, German, and Austrian Romanticism, midcentury Realism, and Belgian Symbolism complement other important works enhancing our already strong 19th-century group, including an early beach landscape by Edgar Degas, a haunting self-portrait by Henri Fantin-Latour, and a large preparatory drawing for the beloved Art Institute painting Paris Street; Rainy Day by Gustave Caillebotte. The survey culminates with images from the first half of the 20th century, among them the momentous pastel January by Grant Wood, creator of another Art Institute icon, American Gothic.\nThe Art Institute received its first major gift of drawings\u2014almost 4,000 European and American works from Walter Gurley in memory of his mother, Leonora Hall Gurley\u2014nearly 100 years ago in 1922. In 1940, the museum brought on its first professional curator dedicated to the medium, Carl O. Schniewind, and began an ambitious program to acquire signal works of drawings. Ongoing curatorial commitment was demonstrated in a 1991 show of the Art Institute\u2019s then-recent drawing acquisitions at the Frick Collection in New York. Twenty-five years later, this presentation offers the chance to experience the debut of these major works in the Art Institute galleries and appreciate how they enrich the museum\u2019s esteemed and wide-ranging collection.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "This spring the Art Institute of Chicago joins forces with The Arts Club of Chicago to host a pair of exhibitions featuring the work of Jean-Luc Mylayne (French, born 1946). The shows unite inside and outside, nature and culture, and bring together again two Chicago institutions that have deep historical ties. Further connecting the twin exhibitions is a third element, a public building in Millennium Park\u2019s Lurie Garden featuring a 30-foot-long photographic fresco covering its entire ceiling.\n\nMylayne has devoted four decades to working with common birds as \u201cactors\u201d in a profound investigation of aesthetics and community. The photographs, typically printed at grand dimensions, are each unique and can take months to prepare. Week after week, at a precise place, in a chosen season, Mylayne and his life partner, Myl\u00e8ne Mylayne, set up cumbersome camera equipment and wait until one or more of the individual birds he has previously identified\u2014and who often seem to recognize him in turn\u2014come to occupy the position he had imagined in his picture. \n\nThe Millennium Park building, designed by Chicago architects Dan Wheeler and Joy Meek, is free and open to the public daily 11:00\u20137:00 throughout the exhibition. Calm and hushed, it is a windowless chapel that offers the miraculous image of a solitary sparrow, apparently perched just above our heads, at the exact corner of a square roof under a brilliant, cloudless sky. The bird is doing something nearly inconceivable: allowing a potential predator to approach from underneath. And visitors have the chance to do something rare enough in our times: transcend our self-imposed barriers to join freely with an Other.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "London-based filmmaker and artist Rosalind Nashashibi\u2019s meditative films merge everyday observations with a more sensuous and even fantastical cinematographic vocabulary. Presented for the first time in the United States after its premiere at documenta 14 in 2017, Nashashibi\u2019s tender and dreamy film Vivian\u2019s Garden depicts the relationship between Austrian Swiss \u00e9migr\u00e9 artists Elisabeth Wild and Vivian Suter\u2014mother and daughter\u2014in the connected houses they share in a jungle garden in Panajachel, located outside of Guatemala City. Wild and Suter have a fluid relationship\u2014the daughter is as much a mother as the other way around. The women live together with Mayan villagers, who act as guardians and maids. Nashashibi\u2019s filmic portrait, which is presented adjacent to Suter\u2019s exhibition el bosque interior in Griffin Court, focuses on the artistic, emotional, and economic lives of the household and offers a delicate look at the complex postcolonial relations within their domestic space. In the fractured moments, incomplete conversations, and intimate interiors that are integral aspects of Nashashibi\u2019s approach to filmmaking, Vivian\u2019s Garden presents a mesmerizing view into lives filled with moments of abstraction and lush beauty.",

  "title": "Undressed: The Fashion of Privacy",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Presented as a companion to the major exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity, which investigates Impressionist artists\u2019 expressive use of contemporary fashion in depictions of public life, this exhibition focuses on the private side of apparel\u2014and the lack thereof. Featuring more than 120 drawings and prints, as well as select paintings, photographs, and materials from the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries, Undressed explores the connotations of informal dress and undress in intimate, personal situations. These images, ranging from the late 18th to the mid-20th century and from continental Europe to the United States, offer a rare glimpse of the inner life of private individuals.\nDisplayed in the Jean and Steven Goldman Prints and Drawings Galleries in the Richard and Mary L. Gray Wing, the exhibition comprises various themes\u2014artist and model, bathers, the domestic sphere, mother and child, romantic (and illicit) relationships, tragedy, and prostitution. The presentation opens with a hallmark theme of 19th-century art: women bathing and grooming themselves. Edgar Degas\u2019s rarely seen pastel Woman at her Toilette is a highlight of this section. Additional works on paper by Mary Cassatt, \u00c9douard Manet, and Pierre Bonnard, as well as The Tub, a sculpture by Degas, illustrate the popularity of the subject across media. Works by Paul C\u00e9zanne and Edvard Munch depict recreational male bathers, while those of Honor\u00e9 Victorin Daumier inject humor into the theme.\nSeveral galleries concentrate on private domestic moments, with explorations of such activities as dressing, sleeping, and reading; Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s Elles portfolio is of particular note, offering a glimpse into an interior world of women. Daumier\u2019s comedic representation of bourgeois grooming is complemented by earlier British caricatures, and tender maternal scenes occupy an entire gallery, highlighted by the beloved works of Cassatt.\nThe drawing Model Reading in the Studio by Gustave Courbet anchors a gallery devoted to artists\u2019 academic depictions of the nude or partially undressed model. Other galleries focus on the darker side of undress\u2014prostitution, murder, and death scenes demonstrate the devastatingly vulnerable nature of nakedness.\nTogether these exceptional\u2014and often rarely seen\u2014works offer an alluring, tender, terrifying, and altogether behind-the-scenes perspective on dress and undress, the fascinating flip side of the very public face of high fashion.",

  "description": "In 1947, while preparing for a Vincent van Gogh exhibition at the museum, Art Institute Director Daniel Catton Rich and Public Relations Counsel Peter Pollack visited Van Gogh's nephew, Vincent Willem van Gogh, to ask him for the loan of many of his uncle's paintings for the show. A close friendship between the men developed, and the three of them set out to visit most of the sites captured by the famous artist in his fabulous paintings. These site visits were documented in photographs taken by Pollack, which now reside in the Art Institute's archives. This exhibition presents some of these historic photographs paired with illustrations of Van Gogh's works.",

  "title": "Moholy-Nagy: Future Present",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Painting, photography, film, sculpture, advertising, product design, theater sets\u2014L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy (American, born Hungary, 1895\u20131946) did it all. Future Present, the first comprehensive retrospective of Moholy-Nagy\u2019s work in the United States in nearly 50 years, brings together more than 300 works to survey the career of a multimedia artist who was always ahead of his time. Moholy, as he was known, came to prominence as a professor at the Bauhaus art school in Germany (1923\u201328). In 1937 he founded the New Bauhaus in Chicago, a school that continues today as the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology. He remains the most renowned international modern artist ever to have resided in Chicago.\n\nA pioneer of abstraction for the industrial age, Moholy insisted that art must be developed from the materials of one\u2019s time, in his case recorded sound, photography, film, and synthetic plastics. He demonstrated that in our era of reproducibility works of art gain fresh meaning with a change in size or even reorientation, reverse printing, or a shift in lighting. For Moholy, every citizen could be creative, and every viewer could educate his or her senses by studying effects of light, transparency, and motion in common materials of everyday modern life.\n\n\u2028Future Present presents a wide body of works ranging in date from 1920, when the artist moved to Germany, until his death in Chicago in 1946. One room shows 38 photomontages\u2014nearly all known compositions in nearly every physical variant\u2014brought together for the first time. Another presents three \u201ctelephone paintings,\u201d a single abstract composition that Moholy ordered in three sizes from an enamel sign factory in 1923; this trio of industrial paintings has been separated for decades. All six of Moholy\u2019s iconic, plunging views from the Berlin Radio Tower are united in another room, while a multimedia installation, Room of the Present, which Moholy conceived in 1930 but could not finish, is brought to life as a room of its own.\n\n\u2028\u2028Special emphasis is given to Moholy\u2019s time in the United States, where his art moved from planar painterly abstractions to three-dimensional hybrids of painting and sculpture. Never have so many of the artist\u2019s late works in Plexiglas\u2014wall-mounted, freestanding, and hanging in midair\u2014been seen together. These works came from Moholy\u2019s teaching at the \u201cChicago Bauhaus,\u201d which is also highlighted through a showing of student work as well as a \u201cteaching wall\u201d that frames Moholy\u2019s greatest pedagogical ideas. The show closes with Moholy\u2019s recorded voice and a projection of abstract color slides that the artist made in part by recording the scribble-like trace of headlights and taillights on Lake Shore Drive at night.\n\nOrganizers\nMoholy-Nagy: Future Present is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; and Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles.\n\nOther Venues\nSolomon R. Guggenheim Museum: May 27\u2013September 7, 2016\nLos Angeles County Museum of Art: February 12\u2013June 18, 2017\n\nCatalogue\nPurchase Moholy-Nagy: Future Present and experience the exhibition through its accompanying catalogue.

  "title": "Todd Eberle: Architectural Abstractions",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Architecture has been a favored subject of photographers since the invention of the medium in the 19th century. Despite the prevalence of architectural images, their purpose is not always apparent. One persistent problem has been the definition of such works: are they views, deliberately framed by the photographer with artistic intent, or are they commercial endeavors, intended to serve an iconic or illustrative purpose? In 1963 British photographer and author Eric de Mare designed the former type as pictures and the latter as illustrations. But underlying this categorization is the assumption that all architectural photographs reflect a building's figurative, perspectival, three-dimensional qualities that the structure is both identifiable and presented within its environmental context.\n\nTodd Eberle's most recent photographic series breaks away from de Mare's fundamental framework, proposing fresh ways of seeing, thinking about, and interpreting architecture. His radically cropped, totally flat representations of interior surfaces transform the figurative into the abstract. His ostensible subject matter in each picture, which we can ascertain only from the title, is secondary to the work's visual construction as a modular, repetitively patterned surface--most often an interior ceiling plane.\n\nThe artist's framed views of ceilings demonstrate the shared roots of 20th-century modern architecture, Minimalism, and conceptual art. The beauty of the architects' designs, through Eberle's lens, lies in the repetition of formal elements. Illuminated by an indirect light source, these abstracted views can create the effect of a radiating light box with none of the usual visual cues that describe a building's boundaries, structure, texture, or materials.\n\nEberle, who is best known for his pictures of Donald Judd's artwork and buildings in Marfa, Texas, started his career taking photographs of such noted artists and architects as Zaha Hadid, Philip Johnson, Brice Marden, and Agnes Martin. He then expanded into architectural and fashion photography. This presentation of his work comprises 12 large-format (60 x 45 in.)\nphotographs, and highlights include the ceiling outside an elevator bank at Gordon Bunshaft's Lever House, New York (2002); an elevator cab at Chicago's Lake Shore Drive apartments by Mies van der Rohe (2002); and a Frank Lloyd Wright ceiling at Unity Temple in Oak Park (2002).\n\nOrganizer\nTodd Eberle: Architectural Abstractions is organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\nCurator\nJoseph Rosa, Department of Architecture and Design, Art Institute of Chicago\n\nOther Venues\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art, December 16, 2005-March 7, 2006\n\nSponsor\nThe exhibition is generously supported by an anonymous donor.\nTodd Eberle.

Featured last year on NBC\u2019s Today show and one of the Art Institute\u2019s most popular attractions, these absorbing period rooms don specially made holiday finery that showcases historical traditions and offers a window into seasonal festivities of the past. New to the decorating tradition this year is the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) room. And, for the first time in 50 years, an original German Rococo room will be displayed.\n\nNine other rooms continue the beloved decorating tradition. Among the most elaborate is the English Drawing Room of the Victorian Period, the only room with a Christmas tree. Now a ubiquitous feature of the season, the Christmas tree or tannenbaum, was only brought to England from Germany in 1840 with the marriage of Prince Albert to Queen Victoria. The Thorne Room tree and accoutrements are based on a famous engraving of the royal couple and their children surrounding a trimmed and toy-bedecked tree, an image that would forever popularize this holiday fixture. Other ornamented rooms include the English Great Hall of the Tudor period with a wassailing bowl, yule log, and an essential part of the costuming for that period\u2019s singing-dancing revelers\u2014a mummer\u2019s mask; the Virginia Entrance Hall with mistletoe, wreath, and garland; the French Provincial Bedroom with shoes, or sabots, lined up before the fireplace, a cr\u00e8che, and puzzle; the modern-era California Hallway with an Otto Natzler mid-century menorah and box with a dreidel; the traditional Chinese interior set to ring in the Chinese New Year; and the New Orleans and New Mexico rooms filled with regional treats of the season.\n\nShare in the delight of these tiny treasures at the museum and enjoy them online with Game of Thornes, a maze of miniature proportions!",

  "description": "Special tickets are not required for this exhibition. Enjoy the exhibition during regular museum hours.\n\n \nAerospace Design: The Art of Engineering from NASA\u2019s Aeronautical Research explores the architecture and engineering of wind tunnels by displaying approximately 90 objects from NASA\u2019s collection, including wind tunnel models and flight artifacts, past and present. The exhibition commemorates the centennial of powered, controlled flight that began with the landmark take off of the Wright brothers on December 17, 1903.\n\nObjects included in the exhibition date back to NASA\u2019s predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), founded in 1915. Created out of that agency at the beginning of the space race in 1958, NASA has a wealth of often unexhibited and unpublished artifacts that not only document technological advances in flight over the past century but are also aesthetically striking. Beyond the historic dimension, the exhibition showcases some of the latest research being done for aircrafts with \"morphing\" wings, self-healing vehicle \"skins\" and biologically inspired sensors\u2014elements that NASA hopes will make future air travel accident free, environmentally friendly, and affordable and accessible. In all, the project presents the history of aeronautically engineered forms in relation to architecture and design, much as previous Art Institute exhibitions have analyzed architecture and design for commercial aviation, space travel, and contemporary railroad travel. Visitors are shown another example of how aviation design is as beautiful as it can be functional.",

  "description": "Special tickets ARE NOT required for this exhibition. Enjoy the exhibition during regular museum hours.\n\nThis major international exhibition provides a detailed survey of the art of Florence during the years that Michelangelo and artists employed by the first Medici grand dukes\u2014such as Cellini, Bronzino, and Pontormo\u2014produced celebrated masterpieces. Works by these artists bolstered the wordly power and status of the ruling family and reflected the sophistication and refinement of Florentine court circles, in which high value was placed upon classical aesthetics and scientific learning. Many of the 200 objects in the exhibition\u2014including sculpture, painting, armor, medals, porcelain, and tapestries\u2014have never before traveled out of Florence. Among the objects on view for the first time in the United States are three sculptures by Michelangelo, some of the greatest paintings of the Uffizi and Pitti Galleries, and works from the famed Studiolo (treasure room) of Francesco I in the Palazzo Vecchio.\n\nThe Medici, Michelangelo, and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence is the first major exhibition in North America devoted to this moment of great achievement and artistic innovation, one of the richest periods in the history of art. Before coming to the Art Institute, the exhibition opened at the Strozzi Palace in Florence. After leaving Chicago it will be seen at the Detroit Institute of Arts.\n\n\nCatalogue\nA fully illustrated, scholarly exhibition catalogue, published by the Yale University Press in association with the Detroit Institute of Arts, accompanies the show.\n\nCurators\nLarry Feinberg, Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Curator of European Painting, the Art Institute; Alan P. Darr, Walter B. Ford II Family Curator of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, the Detroit Institute of Arts; Marco Chiarini, director emeritus, Palazzo Pitti, Florence\n\n\nCollaborators\nThe Medici, Michelangelo, and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence was organized by The Detroit Institute of Arts, the Soprintendenza Speciale per il Polo Museale Fiorentino, and the Opificio delle Pietre Dure of Florence, Italy, with the close collaboration of the The Art Institute of Chicago and the Firenze Mostre, Florence. Travel assistance was provided by Alitalia Airlines.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Ralph Eugene Meatyard (1925\u20131972) has been on the fringes of photographic history\u2014so much so that he inserted one of his own prints into his personal copy of Beaumont Newhall\u2019s classic History of Photography, which did not include him. And yet his impact on photographic practice, belatedly recognized, has been significant. An optician in Lexington, Kentucky, Meatyard sustained a life-long interest in visual perception. Well read and deeply connected to a circle of poets and philosophers, he made photographs rich in literary allusion. Meatyard\u2019s photography was not accidental or documentary, but rather deliberate, often staged, and searching for inner truths rather than ephemeral surfaces.\n\nIn his last decade, Meatyard kept returning to the tropes of dolls and masks, often photographing his children posed in abandoned houses and landscapes. These pictures put an uncanny spin on family photographs, exploring the contrasts between youth and age, childhood and mortality, intimacy and unknowability, sharing and hiding. For Meatyard, dolls represented a physical human presence, whether employed in a scene alongside people or instead of people. He used masks to universalize his sitters rather than make portraits of individuals. Masks reflect the faces we all put on for the camera; indeed, Meatyard\u2019s last project before his untimely death was The Family Album of Lucybelle Crater, a project based on the common snapshot album but featuring friends and family all wearing masks. Drawn from the photographer\u2019s estate, this focused exhibition\u2014all of works made before that iconic project\u2014examines dolls and masks across different bodies of work as a window onto this enigmatic photographer\u2019s larger practice.\n\nThis exhibition is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Special tickets are not required for this exhibition.\n\nGirodet: Romantic Rebel\nFebruary 11\u2013April 30, 2006\nRegenstein Hall\n\nGirodet: Romantic Rebel is the first retrospective in the United States devoted to the works of gifted French painter Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson (1767\u20131824). The exhibition assembles more than 100 seminal works (about 60 paintings and 40 drawings) that demonstrate the artist\u2019s impressive range as a painter as well as a draftsman. \n\nProfoundly shaped by the dramatic social and political upheaval brought about by the French Revolution, Girodet early on broke free from his mentor Jacques-Louis David\u2019s influence and veered away from the rigid Neoclassical style then prevalent in France. He interpreted his subjects in an evocative and dreamlike manner, often adding a strange, erotic charge. Increasingly he explored themes of a more Romantic nature, taking up subjects that involved irrational emotions and the exotic. He executed pictures representing the legends of Ossian, a fanciful Nordic myth contrived by contemporary writer James Macpherson; and the tragic story of the American Indian woman, Atala, based on the eponymous novel by the artist\u2019s friend, Romantic writer Chateaubriand. Also featured in the exhibition are some of the artist\u2019s exotic fantasies, including several drawn and painted studies for the spectacular Revolt of Cairo (1810), a depiction of a Mameluke rebellion in Cairo during Napoleon\u2019s 1798 Egyptian campaign.\n\nIn the range of subjects that he embraced\u2014from family portraits, to mythological fantasies, to Napoleonic battle scenes\u2014Girodet constantly reinvented his style and expanded the boundaries of what was considered appropriate by the French art establishment. His penchant for unconventional interpretation of traditional subjects and his tendency to produce controversial works brought him fame as well as constant challenge. In his innovative exploration of new and exotic themes, visual effects, and untoward or violent emotions, Girodet was an early proponent of what came to be called the Romantic movement in art and literature.\n\n\nCATALOGUE\nThe exhibition catalogue, Girodet: Romantic Rebel, will be available in spring 2006. $65, hardcover. Please contact the Museum Shop at (312) 443-3533 for purchase information.\n\n\nORGANIZERS AND SPONSORS\nThis exhibition was initiated by the Cleveland Museum of Art and organized by the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre and the R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, Paris, in collaboration with the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, in cooperation with the Mus\u00e9e Girodet, Montargis.\n\nThis exhibition is made possible by the Old Masters Society of the Art Institute of Chicago, and through generous contributions from Marilynn Alsdorf; Scott, Lynda, Jonathan, and Lindsey Canel; Alexandra and John Nichols; and Patrick G. and Shirley W.

Organized by the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, this long-overdue survey traces Zarina\u2019s career from 1961 to the present and features approximately 60 works from the artist\u2019s studio, as well as from public and private collections.\n\nZarina Hashmi was born in Aligarh, India, in 1937 and has lived and worked in New York for the past 30 years. Her main medium is paper, which she employs in woodcuts,\netchings, drawings, rubbings, and casts made from paper pulp. Although she is primarily a printmaker, she considers herself to be a sculptor as well, in part because the activity of carving blocks of wood is central to her practice.\n\nZarina\u2019s vocabulary is minimal yet rich in associations. Her abstract compositions are inextricably linked to her life and to the themes of dispossession and exile that have marked it. Her family is Muslim but chose to stay in India following the partition of 1947, which resulted in the uprooting and deaths of millions of people. Conditions in India eventually made it impossible for them to remain any longer, but by the time her parents chose to immigrate to Pakistan in 1959, Zarina was married and living in Thailand. She was unable to return to her childhood home and was also not \u201cat home\u201d in Pakistan. She later lived in Germany, France, and Japan before settling in the United States. The concept of home\u2014whether personal, geographical, national, spiritual, or familial\u2014resonates throughout Zarina\u2019s work. The lines that define her spaces are never anonymous; on the contrary, they are handcrafted and calligraphic. Although it appears in different guises throughout her oeuvre, her distinctive sense of line is the unifying element of her compositions, like an umbilical cord that ties her to this world regardless of where she is.\n\nZarina, who chooses to be referred to simply by her first name, was a prominent figure in feminist circles of the New York art scene in the 1970s. While her work has been featured in major exhibitions and is represented in important public collections, including those of the Hammer Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, this exhibition marks the most comprehensive survey to date of her strikingly beautiful, contemplative, and poetic oeuvre.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "One of England\u2019s most important artists and independent filmmakers, and a founder of the pioneering Sankofa Film and Video Collective (1983\u201392), Isaac Julien creates highly seductive films and video installations that explore the representation of race and masculinity in visual culture.\n\nConflating conventional cinematic structure with avant-garde techniques, Julien subverts stereotypical portrayals of black and gay subjects, forcing viewers to question accepted representational archetypes. Produced collaboratively with Venezuela-born choreographer Javier De Frutos, The Long Road to Mazatl\u00e1n is a modern cowboy story. Shot in and around San Antonio, Texas, the film captures the erotically charged interchanges between a young Hispanic man and the emotionally unavailable cowboy he pursues. Shot in lush color and layered imagery, the protagonists play out, as actors and at times as dancers, the subtle drama of the everyday, performing within carefully constructed environments. Through selected editing and the use of a three-screen installation, the artist composes a mise-en-sc\u00e8ne that explores the social construction of masculinity within the mythic landscape of the American West.\n\nThe Long Road to Mazatl\u00e1n was originally commissioned by Artpace San Antonio.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "With a career spanning 35 years, Christopher Williams (born 1956) now stands as one of the leading contemporary artists engaged in photography. Deeply invested in the techniques and history of photography, Williams is just as profoundly committed to contemporary art as a forum for intellectual inquiry and thoughtful opposition\u2014resisting, for example, a capitalist society in which photographs typically act as agents of consumer spectacle. Through exacting mimicry\u2014and stunningly beautiful images\u2014Williams\u2019s work has subtly questioned the conventions of photojournalism, picture archives, fashion, and commercial imaging. This exhibition\u2014a multipart installation conceived by the artist that spans three gallery spaces on three floors of the museum\u2014is Williams\u2019s first retrospective. It also marks a homecoming for the artist, who had his first-ever museum showing in 1982 at the Art Institute.\n\nThe survey begins with films from Williams\u2019s studies at the California Institute of the Arts, where he earned his MFA in 1981 and took classes with John Baldessari and Michael Asher. Alongside the films and SOURCE (1981), Williams\u2019s first mature work, is a classic early piece, Angola to Vietnam* (1989), shown in its 27-part entirety, as well as works of the 1990s, mainly from For Example: Die Welt ist sch\u00f6n (1993\u20132001), an eight-year project inspired in part by the 1920s photographs of Albert Renger-Patzsch. This part of the exhibition is presented in the photography galleries in the historic building, which the artist is transforming through interventions to the modular wall system.\n\nThe Modern Wing\u2019s Bucksbaum Gallery for Photography displays a single photograph, a key piece in which Williams first made clear his conception of photographs as a form of installation art, Bouquet for Bas Jan Ader and Christopher d\u2019Arcangelo (1991). Extensive selections from Williams\u2019s ongoing project, For Example: Dix-huit Le\u00e7ons sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 industrielle (begun in 2004), are presented in the architecture and design galleries on the second floor of the Modern Wing.\n\nUnited across all three levels of the museum by the artist\u2019s use of \u201csupergraphics\u201d\u2014lengthy text excerpts printed at enormous size on a boldly colored background\u2014The Production Line of Happiness offers 35 years of beautifully made, conceptually rich photography that mines the history of contemporary art and modern political opposition. After its debut at the Art Institute, the exhibition will travel to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Whitechapel Gallery, London.",

From a completely black sky to a realistic depiction of a soft glow at twilight, the printed expression of evening evolved in concert with increasingly complex printing techniques. \n\nIn some of the earliest prints on view, the sky is a solid curtain of black placed behind figures searching for fireflies. The 19th-century master Utagawa Hiroshige captured his beloved city of Edo (present-day Tokyo) and the surrounding countryside in images in which darkness lends a hushed atmosphere to familiar scenes. \n\nBy the 20th century, artists expressed the various moods associated with nighttime through the depiction of shadows, the brightness of a single star, the reflections of the moon on vast oceans or small puddles, and the quietude of lonely travelers. In particular, Kawase Hasui\u2019s obsession with the effects of small amounts of light on an otherwise dark scene resulted in some of the most haunting images in the history of Japanese prints.\nImage: 1944.436",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "One of the most influential American artists, William Eggleston changed the history of color photography. This exhibition\u2014the artist\u2019s first retrospective in the United States\u2014brings together Eggleston\u2019s famous color photographs of the American South with lesser-known works, such as his early black-and-white prints and provocative video recordings.\n\nA key figure of the last half-century, Eggleston is often credited for singlehandedly ushering in the era of color art photography. His motivation was simple and decidedly everyday: \u201cI had wanted to see a lot of things in color because the world is in color.\u201d His achievement is patently more extraordinary\u2014transforming ordinary moments into indelible images.\n\nThis exhibition, which fills the Modern Wing\u2019s Abbott Galleries and Carolyn S. and Matthew Bucksbaum Gallery, demonstrates Eggleston\u2019s democratic approach to his photographic subjects in both color and black-and-white. On display are Eggleston\u2019s remarkable black-and-white images from the early 1960s and his little-seen recording of 1970s Memphis nightlife, Stranded in Canton. These works only amplify his achievement in bringing a detailed sensitivity to his iconic color photographs\u2014telling portrayals of American culture, including a freezer stuffed with food, Elvis\u2019s Graceland, and a supermarket clerk corralling grocery carts in the afternoon sunlight.\n\nInternationally acclaimed, Eggleston has spent the past four decades photographing around the world, responding intuitively to fleeting configurations of cultural signs and specific expressions of local color. Psychologically complex and casually refined, bordering on kitsch and never conventionally beautiful, these photographs have had a pervasive influence on many contemporary artists. By not censoring, rarely editing, and always photographing even the seemingly banal, Eggleston convinces us completely of the idea of the democratic camera.\n\nThis exhibition will be closed on Friday, May 7 due to the School of the Art Institute's 2010 Fashion Show. \n\nPlease note that some of the exhibition's videos contain potentially disturbing content.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The three slide projections in this presentation, shown together in 1975 but rarely seen since, mark a point of intersection between land art and body art\u2014two areas pioneered by sculptor and media artist Dennis Oppenheim (American, 1938\u20132011). In these intimate and personal works, the artist used performances for the camera to explore the theme of mourning and to model an intergenerational transfer of psychic or creative energies. Shot from a helicopter, 2000' Shadow Projection (1972), shows the artist alone in a field, standing in the stark beam of a far-reaching searchlight; he repeatedly plays a one-note dirge on a trumpet, an act of memorial to his father, who had died the same year. In Ground Gel #2 (1972), also photographed from above, he whirls his young daughter, Chandra, round and round, their figures appearing to merge with each other as well as with the ground as the slides progress. Whispering, \u201cI want to go there...\u201d as he whirls his daughter around, Oppenheim propels an exchange of action and energy that seems to exceed the material boundaries of his own bodily form. Grandfather and granddaughter meet symbolically in the third work, Polarities (1972). Using red magnesium flares, Oppenheim created two \u201clandscape drawings,\u201d together stretching more than 1,000 feet, by plotting enlarged versions of a doodle drawn by his father the night before he died and one of Chandra\u2019s first artworks.\n\nSlides give a perfect metaphor for themes of separation and interdependence, causing images to shift and dissolve like the bodies they symbolize or depict. \u201cMy work,\u201d Oppenheim described in 1973, \u201clies on the attempt to remove the frontier between an action directed from within the bounds of my life and the one I try to direct, at the same time, beyond those bounds.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition is presented jointly by the Department of Photography and the Department of Modern and Contemporary Art. A selection of related lithographs by Dennis Oppenheim, recent gifts of Irving Stenn, Jr., is on view nearby in Gallery 189.",

Prior to the adoption of the Copyright Act of 1976, the term of copyright protection in the United States was determined by the more complicated rules of the Copyright Act of 1909, under which the copyright term was based on when and how the artwork was published, as opposed to when the work was created or when the artist died.\nUnfortunately for the sake of simplicity, if not the employment prospects of American copyright lawyers, the more complicated rules of the 1909 Act remain relevant today. The 1976 Act and later amendments have not changed the basic premise that most artworks created prior to 1978 have a copyright term that depends on their publication history, i.e. when images of the artworks appeared in books, periodicals, prints, or other publicly-available copies. Thus, to determine whether an artwork older than 30 years is still protected under United States copyright law, it is often necessary to visit an art library to research when and how images of the artwork have been published.\nUsing artworks from the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, this exhibition highlights several of the unique publication-based rules of United States copyright law.",

  "title": "The Czech Avant-Garde Book",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In the period between the two world wars artistic movements in Czechoslovakia produced outstanding examples of avant-garde book cover design, layout and typography. Czech artists, designers and architects adopted and developed trends from the avant-garde in other parts of Europe and created what they saw as a new approach to book cover design and typography. These artists rejected the bibliophile tradition of book design and sought instead to use avant-garde aesthetics to create simply produced books that could be made available to all. This was not merely an attempt to put modern art on a book cover but rather to rethink the entire aesthetics of the thing and so produce a modern book and a modern book cover.\nThis exhibition covers the work of the Czech artists and designers Ladislav Sutnar, Toyen, Jind\u0159ich \u0160tyrsk\u00fd, Karel Teige and several others. Many of the designers of these books were members of the Dev\u011btsil artist group, which was founded in Prague in 1920. Early on Dev\u011btsil artists began producing \"Pictorial Poems,\" which used the techniques of collage and photomontage to visually recreate the lyricism of poetry and can be seen on the covers of some of their books. These artists also drew from other artistic movements such as Constructivism, Surrealism, and Socialist Realism to create what are often graphically striking designs. This exhibition is drawn from the Ryerson Library's special collections, especially the Leibowits and Mary Reynolds collections.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Pablo Picasso (1881\u20131973) was one of the most influential, prolific, and discussed artists of the 20th century. Although best known as a painter, sculptor, and printmaker, he was also one of the most, if not the most, productive collaborator on and creator of artists' books, also sometimes called livres d'artiste.\nPicasso's role in the creation of books varied. For some titles, he created illustrations to complement the text; in others, he pulled illustrations from his earlier work. Most frequently, Picasso worked with friends, either by illustrating their books, by drawing their portraits as frontispieces, or by working for those that were publishers to help launch a new project. He was such an important commodity for most of his career that he could pick and choose his endeavors, and despite the myriad ventures that were certainly denied, he still managed to create 156 illustrated books and countless other illustrations for magazines and other ephemera.\nThe types of illustrated publications ranged from editions of classic literature by authors such as Balzac and Ovid to volumes of surrealist poetry to cultural journals such as Minotaure and Verve. The wide assortment is a reflection of Picasso's inexhaustible creativity and many interests.\nThe standard catalog of Picasso's work in books is Sebastian Goeppert et al., Pablo Picasso The Illustrated Books Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 (Geneva: Patrick Cramer, 1963), cited below as Cramer.",

  "title": "Ancient Chinese Bronzes from the Shouyang Studio: The Katherine and George Fan Collection (working title)",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "For the ruling elite of ancient China, prestigious objects of bronze signified supreme political power, devout spiritual beliefs, and exalted social status. Foremost among these bronzes are vessels that were used for the ritual preparation and offering of food and drink to deceased ancestors. Beginning in about 1200 B.C., many of these bronzes were cast with pictographic images or insignia and sometimes with archaic forms of Chinese written characters. Whether naming an honoree, recounting a military campaign, or declaring an imperial edict, such inscriptions preserve firsthand, if highly formulaic, records of their time. Inscribed bronzes also present us with some of the earliest evidence for China\u2019s most prized cultural possession\u2014its written language.\n\nOver the past millennium, ancient bronzes have been collected and studied by Chinese intellectuals, who have valued inscriptions as direct links to antiquity. Today, both Western and Chinese scholars continue this epigraphic tradition while also benefiting from important insights gleaned from ongoing archaeological finds. Among the most eminent proponents of these historical perspectives are the collectors George and Katherine Fan of New York, who have chosen \u201cShouyang\u201d as the traditional \u201cstudio\u201d name for their bronze collection.\n\nThis exhibition features 72 bronzes collected by the Fans over more than 20 years. Also included is a set of models that illustrates the technique of piece-mold casting distinctive to ancient Chinese foundries. The Shanghai Museum, where the exhibition opened in 2009, has generously lent this reconstruction, as well as ink impressions (rubbings) of all inscriptions and prominent surface designs. Together with the bronzes, these materials illuminate historical, epigraphic, stylistic, and technical developments that span almost two millennia, from the early Bronze Age through China\u2019s first centralized empire.",

  "title": "Making Place: The Architecture of David Adjaye",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "With over 50 built projects across the world, David Adjaye is rapidly emerging as a major international figure in architecture and design. Rather than advancing a signature architectural style, Adjaye\u2019s structures address local concerns and conditions through both a historical understanding of context and a global understanding of modernism. The first comprehensive museum survey devoted to Adjaye, this exhibition offers an in-depth overview of the architect\u2019s distinct approach and visual language with a dynamic installation design conceived by Adjaye Associates.\n\nOf African ancestry and raised in Ghana, the Middle East, and England, Adjaye now has offices in London, New York, Berlin, and Accra. Like many international architects, he is itinerant, and his practices defy cultural borders and geopolitical categories. However, Adjaye is unique in being an African-born architect working in a global landscape. Having traveled the world studying buildings and architectural styles, most recently and extensively in Africa, he is acutely sensitive to the effects of location. A proponent for architecture from beyond the Western canon, he brings a distinctive contemporary \u201cAfropolitan\u201d view to his various projects.\n\nWhile Adjaye has never adhered to a discrete style, his projects coalesce around certain ideas. Often set in cities struggling with diversity and difference, his public buildings provide spaces that foster links among people and explore how neighborhoods evolve, how new communities are created, and how unexpected junctures weave diverse urban identities and experiences into the tapestry of multiculturalism. Rethinking conventions, his designs speak to the specific time and place in which they were made. These ideas are expressed in important recent projects, such as the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., a building that faces history head-on, bringing together references from across Africa and America in a visually and physically evocative design.\n\nThis exhibition, comprising furniture, housing, public buildings, and master plans, fills the first-floor Abbott Galleries and the second-floor architecture and design galleries in the Modern Wing. In addition to drawings, sketches, models, and building mock-ups, a specially commissioned film featuring Adjaye\u2019s collaborators\u2014an international roster of artists, the exhibition curators, and other influential figures in the art world\u2014helps bring his projects to life and makes clear the important role that Adjaye plays in contemporary architecture today.\n\nSponsors\nMaking Place: The Architecture of David Adjaye is organized by Haus der Kunst, Munich, and the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nMajor funding has been generously provided by Nancy Carrington Crown and A. Steven Crown and Barbara Bluhm-Kaul and Don Kaul.\n\nThe Auxiliary Board of the Art Institute of Chicago is the Lead Affiliate Sponsor.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue, David Adjaye: Form, Heft, Material, has been underwritten by Nancy Carrington Crown and A. Steven Crown.\n\nAdditional support for the exhibition has been provided by the Fellows and Benefactors of the Architecture and Design Department, the Architecture & Design Society, the Leadership Advisory Committee, Cheryl and Eric McKissack, the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, and Linda Johnson Rice.\n\nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v. S. Levy, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, and the Woman\u2019s Board.",

  "title": "Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "This exhibition on the art of Roy Lichtenstein (American, 1923\u20131997) included nearly 170 works made between 1950 and 1997, focusing on the artist's achievements in painting, sculpture, and drawing. It was the first major retrospective to broadly examine his art since his death.\nLichtenstein is a figure of monumental importance in the recent history of art. His contribution\u2014the still-potent collision of commercial sources and fine art\u2014defined the enduring legacy of Pop Art. The idea of compositional unity was central to the artist's thinking. Plastic values such as beauty and balance were of primary importance to Lichtenstein, and reliable formal tropes\u2014outlines, halftone dots, and solid diagonals\u2014were the building blocks of nearly all his compositions.\nThe first phase of Lichtenstein's mature career was defined by his \"cartoon\" mode. After 1966 he applied his comic style to a broad range of found imagery. The artist almost always began with a two-dimensional source, often a comic image or another readily distillable form of printed mass communication. He then sketched the image, recomposing it to suit narrative clarity or formal ends. Subsequently, he traced the drawing onto canvas, continuing to make compositional adjustments, and then painted the work, sometimes with the aid of assistants.\nThe tactile sites\u2014in print media\u2014from which Lichtenstein's art emerged are growing progressively extinct. More than 50 years after his opening salvo, his work seems wiser than ever in its insistence on the authority of the artificial. Ultimately, there is a profound radicalness in his project, more extreme than the initially transgressive embrace of pop culture. Impeccable sleight of hand is Lichtenstein's revolutionary stance. In restating the mass-produced image by means of an insistently handmade, painterly process, he confounded the notion of the readymade and forever expanded and altered our understanding of how a painting can be made, how it should look, and how we define the artist in our society.",

  "title": "Beyond Golden Clouds: Japanese Screens from the Art Institute of Chicago and the Saint Louis Art Museum",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Part utilitarian and part fine art, the Japanese folding screen has captured the imaginations of those in the West since the 16th century. Japanese screens were then, as they are now, the decorated surface par excellence, connoting status, good taste, and indeed, Japan itself. Stretching across their surfaces are, for the most part, compositions of bright mineral pigments rendered on gleaming gold-leaf grounds. Unfortunately, however varied the subjects portrayed and the painting styles adopted, there are very few opportunities today to see large numbers of screens displayed together at once, and museum visitors often must satisfy themselves with only one or two examples at a time. With Beyond Golden Clouds: Japanese Screens from the Art Institute of Chicago and the Saint Louis Art Museum, we seek to reveal the dynamism of the screen format\u2014its lasting meaning in Japan and its persistent appeal abroad\u2014presented in both premodern and contemporary incarnations.\nThe exhibition celebrates the possibilities of the screen format in a way only the collaboration of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Saint Louis Art Museum could achieve, drawing as it does on the Art Institute\u2019s strength in decorative and iconic screens of the seventeenth century and Saint Louis\u2019s pivotal calligraphic screens and contemporary works. An extensive full-color catalogue edited by myself and including contributions by top scholars in the field will be available in June.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The first major exhibition devoted to celebrated Chicago-born, Los Angeles\u2013based sculptor Charles Ray since a midcareer retrospective in 1998, this display of 19 works fills the second floor of the Modern Wing and flows into the museum\u2019s South Garden, presenting a full range of Ray\u2019s most recent achievements with particular emphasis on figurative experiments. The exhibition, co-organized by the Art Institute and the Kunstmuseum Basel, can only be seen in the United States at the Art Institute, and six sculptures\u2014including four new works in their museum debut: Horse and Rider, Huck and Jim, Silver, and Girl on Pony\u2014are on view only in Chicago.\n\nOn technical and formal levels, Ray has been redefining the possibilities of contemporary sculptural practice since the early 1980s. His recent pioneering use of solid, machined aluminum and stainless steel is entirely new to the history of art, its reflective qualities and fluid effects belying the tremendous weight of many of Ray\u2019s life-size and over-life-size works. As the exhibition demonstrates, Ray\u2019s latest sculptures evidence a verisimilitude that can range in a single work from painstakingly exact to a softer, more stylized rendering. The works, materially and conceptually dense, often emerge from a long process of study, experimentation, refinement, and meticulous execution. Ray himself has described his objects not as the product of an obsessive practice but rather as the manifestation of \u201cdiscipline and persistence.\u201d With works sometimes ten years in the making, Ray\u2019s process can be likened to a river eroding or reshaping stones over time. \n\nThis intensive working method, along with the sculptures\u2019 highly technical creation and carefully controlled display, yields works that are timeless yet utterly contemporary. Throughout the exhibition, viewers can trace themes of boyhood, sleep, ghosts, self-portraiture, and myths of American popular culture, as well as recognize references to Classical statues and the revival of ancient techniques such as bas relief. Yet there are also many conceptual aspects to Ray\u2019s work\u2014space and time, physical and psychological presence\u2014that form a matrix of migrating allusions and allegorical meaning.",

  "is_featured": true,
  "description": "WALL TEXT\n\nIn the 1890s, a new generation of artists emerged who came of age after the height of Impressionism and pioneered a variety of different artistic styles. Unified primarily by their close personal friendships with each other, many of the artists on display in this gallery became known as Intimists, named for their generally smaller-scale works and intimate subject matter. Unlike the Impressionists, who often portrayed landscapes, outdoor gardens, or city streets, these artists focused instead on interior scenes as a way to experiment with color, form, pattern, and atmosphere. They populated these domestic spaces with relatives, friends, or employees, who tend to blend into their decorative settings. Some artists, inspired by the sculptures of Rodin, chose to focus on the female body, while others used their children or household pets to fill the spaces they created.\n\nIn alignment with international movements such as Art Nouveau, the artists Pierre Bonnard and \u00c9douard Vuillard were also preoccupied with breaking down barriers between the \u201chigh art\u201d form of painting, and \u201ccraft\u201d media that included furniture and the decorative arts. The paintings, prints, and pastels in this gallery were mostly intended for display in private spaces, such as apartments or houses, where they would become a part of the viewer\u2019s everyday life. The artists envisioned that by bringing innovative art into the home\u2014a place typically reserved for \u201ccraft\u201d\u2014they would erode the distinctions between art and life, and produce psychologically intimate, art-filled spaces for reflection.",

  "description": "The World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 was organized to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1492. The Exposition, or Fair as it is often called, came to represent an important moment in the history of Chicago and American culture. Chicago took great pride in securing the honor of hosting this monumental event\u2014beating out a number of other cities, such as Washington, D.C. and New York. The city saw this as an opportunity to ensure its standing as a place of great creativity, ingenuity and cultural refinement. The Fair hosted the largest exhibition of art in the United States at the time, with more than 10,000 works of art. But more than anything the World's Columbian Exposition became well known for its architecture. The Fair consisted of fourteen \"Great Buildings\"\u2014the largest of which was the Manufactures and Liberal Art Building\u2014and over 200 other buildings.\nAs the Director of Works for the Fair, Daniel H. Burnham (1846-1912) oversaw all aspects of design and construction. He planned to make the architecture and decorative elements the Fair's crowning achievement, and something for which it would always be remembered. To this end Burnham set out to employ the most talented architects, designers, and artists to create the grand and palatial buildings and grounds. Included in this exhibition are some of the caricatures of artists, designers and officials of the World's Columbian Exposition from the Daniel H. Burnham archival collection. The collection consists of over fifty caricatures. Three artists involved in the Fair created the majority of them: Robert Lewis Reid (1862-1929), Edward Emerson Simmons (1852-1931), and Charles Yardley Turner (1850-1919).",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Timothy H. O\u2019Sullivan (1840\u20131882) was one of the most important American photographers of the nineteenth century. While employed by Mathew B. Brady and Alexander Gardner, O\u2019Sullivan made iconic images of the American Civil War. After the war, O\u2019Sullivan served as the official photographer for three U.S. government survey expeditions: the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel (or \u201cKing Survey\u201d) of 1867\u201369 and 1872; the Darien (Isthmus of Panama) Expedition of 1870; and the Geological Surveys West of the 100th Meridian (or \u201cWheeler Survey\u201d) of 1871 and 1873\u201374. His images of the West are of great historical and artistic significance: working alongside geologists, naturalists, and surveyors, O\u2019Sullivan produced some of the earliest and most influential photographs of the American frontier.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan\u2019s work in the King Survey\u2014which covered an 800-mile-long swath of land, roughly straddling the path of the transcontinental rail route, from southern Wyoming to the California line\u2014is of particular importance to his career and to the history of American photography. His photographs of barren landscapes, notable or curious geological formations, and mining operations represent a raw, powerful vision of this little-understood territory increasingly occupied by white Americans. In addition, these images have remained challenging touchstones in photographic history\u2014a perfect, if enigmatic, union of documentary and artistic intentions, fact and interpretation. While a few of these images have been widely reproduced, original prints are remarkably rare. Timothy H. O\u2019Sullivan: The King Survey Photographs includes photographs contextualized with contemporaneous survey reports and topographical and geological atlases that show visual depictions of the land across media.\n\nThis exhibition has been organized by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. In Chicago, this exhibition is made possible by the Smart Family Foundation.\n\nOrganizer\nThis exhibition has been organized by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.\n\nSponsor\nGenerous support for the presentation at the Art Institute of Chicago is provided by the Smart Family Foundation.",

  "description": "Seeking to make \u201ceveryday objects shriek aloud,\u201d or make the familiar unfamiliar, Belgian artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte created some of the 20th century\u2019s most extraordinary\u2014and indelible\u2014images. This exhibition, the first major museum show to focus on the artist\u2019s most profoundly inventive and experimental years, features over 100 paintings, collages, drawings, and objects, along with a selection of photographs, periodicals, and early commercial work, that trace the birth of the themes and strategies Magritte would go on to use throughout his long, productive career\u2014and which make his paintings so unforgettable today.\n\nThe exhibition begins in 1926 in Brussels, where Magritte created paintings and works on paper that first gained him recognition as a Surrealist and that aimed, in his words, to \u201cchallenge the real world.\u201d It follows the artist to Paris in 1927, where he met Surrealists like Andr\u00e9 Breton, Salvador Dal\u00ed, and Joan Mir\u00f3, and created his first breakthrough word-image paintings such as his legendary The Treachery of Images, perhaps better known by its playfully perplexing message, \u201cCeci n\u2019est pas une pipe.\u201d Returning to Brussels in 1930, Magritte continued his search for new forms of image making and in 1933 began a series of paintings that provoked disturbing and unexpected associations between things that make the ordinary and daily life strange.\n\nThe exhibition concludes with a remarkable group of works Magritte made in London and in Brussels between 1937 and 1938, with a particular emphasis on the commissions he completed for the eccentric British collector Edward James, including the Art Institute\u2019s own Time Transfixed. The show\u2019s chronological endpoint, 1938, marks both a historically and biographically significant moment: it was just before the outbreak of World War II and the year Magritte delivered an important retrospective account of what had made him a Surrealist painter.\n\nThroughout these seminal years, Magritte used displacement, transformation, metamorphosis, and the \u201cmisnaming\u201d of objects as well as the representation of visions seen in half-waking states, consistently unsettling the balance between nature and artifice, truth and fiction, reality and surreality. His images, then and still today, force us to question the nature of appearances\u2014both in the paintings and in reality itself.",

  "title": "America after the Fall: Painting in the 1930s",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "What is American art? That is a question the country\u2019s artists asked and answered in myriad ways during the decade spanning the economic crash of 1929 through America\u2019s entry into World War II. With economic downturn at home and the rising threat of fascism abroad, artists of the time applied their individualized visions of the nation to rethinking modernism. This exhibition brings together 50 works by some of the foremost artists of the era\u2014including Edward Hopper, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and Grant Wood\u2014to examine the landscape of the United States during the Great Depression and the many avenues artists explored as they sought to forge a new national art and identity.\n\nCollectively, the aesthetically and politically varied works produced in the 1930s paint a revealing portrait of the nation\u2019s evolving psyche. Edward Hopper\u2019s reflective, melancholy approach to homegrown subjects is quite different from the bold romanticism of Thomas Hart Benton and his fellow Regionalists, who sought to create a national art that glorified America. Painters such as Philip Evergood and Ben Shahn used social realism to protest political attitudes of the time, highlighting the plights of migrant sharecroppers, Jewish immigrants, and other marginalized members of society. Racial issues also came to the fore: Joe Jones chillingly depicted a lynching in American Justice, while Aaron Douglas inserted a more inclusive vision of black culture into the heroic histories of the United States. History, in fact, was frequently used to speak to present times; realist Charles Sheeler linked the earlier, spare American aesthetic of Shaker objects to his exploration of the contemporary, while Grant Wood took on the country\u2019s founding myths in works such as Parson Weems\u2019 Fable.\n\nAt the same time, other artists reinvigorated the revolt against representational style, championing nonobjective art as a form that spoke deeply to modern concerns. The Park Avenue Cubists continued to evolve a European-based abstraction, and modernists such as Stuart Davis and Charles Demuth applied a precise, geometric vocabulary to American architecture and advertising.\n\nBringing these diverse works of art together, America after the Fall tells the story of a nation\u2019s fall from grace and irrevocable changes to the American dream. Following its installation at the Art Institute, the exhibition travels to the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie in Paris and London\u2019s Royal Academy, marking the first time many of these iconic American works\u2014including Grant Wood\u2019s American Gothic\u2014have journeyed beyond North America. For French and British audiences, this traveling exhibition offers an unprecedented opportunity to experience these masterpieces firsthand. For all the show\u2019s visitors, the presentation affords a trailblazing look at the turbulent economic, political, and aesthetic world of the 1930s and the critical and dynamic process of rethinking modernism that it fostered.",

  "description": "Anne Imhof is one of the most important and pioneering artists of her generation, as her work establishes a new paradigm for performance art and gives form and voice to the lingering alienation that is so tangible in contemporary society. In Imhof\u2019s durational performance and installation projects, the complex of technology, isolation, and identity is manifested in both the bodies of the performers and the architecture of the installation. Glass partitions, steel constructions, and uncanny structures become the arena in which a choreographed group of performers and musicians exist, both detached from each other and moving in unison. \n\nHer work Faust was presented in the German Pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennial in 2017, for which she was awarded the prestigious Golden Lion, and her groundbreaking installation Angst was shown at Kunsthalle Basel and Hamburger Bahnhof in 2016. At the Art Institute\u2014for her first solo museum exhibition in the United States\u2014Imhof builds on the aesthetic of these previous projects and combines music, choreography, painting, and sculpture to stage a new installation commissioned specifically for the museum.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Perhaps no other country underwent such drastic change after World War II as Japan. A traditional island nation before the war, in 1945 the country lay in ruins after relentless air raids and the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The American Occupation lasted until 1952 and brought not only American armed forces but also American products and attitudes. Japan was able to recover from the war's devastation and modernization and developing technology led to such rapid economic growth that Tokyo hosted the Olympics in 1964. In 1969, student protests erupted in Japan and disenchantment with the newfound wealth and development was a common theme in the Seventies. Still vested in its traditions, Japan was transforming into a more modern, more Western place. \n\nPhotography was the perfect medium to capture these post-war tensions. After the deprivation of the war years, the Japanese public was ready to consume books and magazines, the usual forms for publishing photography, and exhibitions were commonly held in department stores. Pre-war photographers returned to the old objective style, but photographers first taking up their cameras developed a new way to document their changing world and a new aesthetic philosophy: the individual behind the lens was important to the photograph. Apres-guerre (French for 'after war') was adopted into Japanese as apure geru, and apure came to be used on its own as an adjective meaning cool, new, stylish, and bold. It was just the right word to describe the new, post-war photography in Japan.",

  "title": "Decidedly Surreal: The Bindings of Mary Louise Reynolds",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Mary Louise Reynolds (1891\u20131950) was one of the central figures of the Surrealist movement. As a young American war widow, Reynolds moved to Paris in 1919, where she lived for the rest of her life, except during 1943\u201344, the last two years of the Nazi occupation. In Paris she met the circle of artists and writers who formed the Surrealist movement, becoming a lifelong friend and benefactor to many of them. Reynolds met Marcel Duchamp (1887\u20131968) in July 1923 and began what he called \"a true liaison, over many, many years, and very agreeable.\"\nIn the 1920s, Reynolds studied in the atelier of Parisian master bookbinder Pierre Legrain (1888\u20131929). She applied her skills to the books given to her by such friends as Man Ray, Paul \u00c9luard, Max Ernst, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Jean Cocteau, and Salvador Dal\u00ed. In these works she departed from convention, reworking and manipulating traditional binding elements and structures. She also incorporated a range of materials that were visually and intellectually surprising, from uniquely decorated endpapers to corset stays, broken teacup handles, thermometers, sponge rubber, reptile skins, and kid gloves. Duchamp described her bindings as being \"marked by a decidedly surrealist approach and an unpredictable fantasy.\"\nAfter Reynolds\u2019s death, her brother Frank B. Hubachek, a trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago, decided to keep her collection of nearly 300 books, exhibition catalogues, periodicals, pamphlets, and other ephemera together as a memorial and donated it to the museum in 1954. At the heart of the Mary Reynolds Collection, housed within the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries, are 74 volumes bound by Reynolds. This exhibition showcases a selection of these visionary and uniquely surreal artworks.",

  "description": "Exploring the many facets of antiquarian scholarship in England, this exhibition features 17th- through 19th-century publications celebrating ancient relics, artifacts, architecture, and costume.\n\nThe title of this exhibition stems from Thomas Madox\u2019s The History and Antiquities of the Exchequer of the Kings of England (1711), in which Madox responds to the allegation that the study of antiquities has no meaning for modern man. He asserts that the study of antiquities cannot be separated from the study of history and that history cannot be understood without all of its parts, both ancient and modern, making antiquarianism and an interest in \u201cold antiquated things\u201d imperative.\n\nMadox was one of England's many antiquaries, or scholars of history with particular interest in empirical evidence and artifacts. Antiquaries had wide-ranging interests, including heraldry, relics, art, architecture, clothing, genealogy, and numismatics. Their love of the past included both foreign and British topics, and antiquarian research of British history and genealogy would eventually contribute to a developing concept of national heritage. \n\nPlease note: this exhibition is open on weekdays only.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "This exhibition traces the art of landscape and garden design from the 17th century through the 20th century in Europe and the United States. From the fanciful and Baroque pleasure gardens of German architect Paul Decker (1677-1713) to the beautiful watercolor proposals of landscape designer Humphry Repton (1752-1818), this presentation highlights prominent architects, theorists, and landscape designers using illustrated treatises, manuals, plans, and other printed materials from the rich collection of the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries.\nBeginning with early formal European gardens, the meticulously detailed plans on display show the pools, fountains, ornamental buildings, and sculpted hedges in these gardens, along with symmetrical parterre sample patterns and designs. Also of note are the plates and plans of mazes and labyrinths from the 17th and 18th centuries and the plans of British architect Sir William Chambers (1723-1796) for the landscape at Kew Gardens. English landscape designer Humphry Repton\u2019s original illustrated proposals from the early 19th century are on display as well, with hinged overlays that open to reveal his vision for the landscape. Twentieth-century garden manuals from the United States show how elements of formal European gardens could be used as an inspiration for homeowners for modest gardens on a smaller scale.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In 1887 Ambroise Vollard (1866\u20131939) arrived in Paris with few contacts and no credentials to pursue a career as an art dealer. He began representing artists that were undervalued, exhibiting them at a time when many galleries were not willing to take the risk. In 1895 Vollard hosted C\u00e9zanne\u2019s first solo exhibition, and in doing so he made the artist\u2019s reputation as well as his own.\n\nBy the early 20th century, Vollard had become the principal dealer of artists such as Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin, and a number of Fauve artists, and lent early support to artists who are well known today\u2014Pierre Bonnard, Aristide Maillol, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Edouard Vuillard\u2014as well as many who remain relatively unknown. His shrewd mind for business and artistic sense made him the leading contemporary art dealer of his generation.\n\nC\u00e9zanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde draws upon the dealer\u2019s archives\u2014handwritten sale and purchase records, stockbooks, photography, and correspondence\u2014to shed new light not only on Vollard\u2019s business strategies but also on the heretofore unexplored story of his relationships with artists whose work he exhibited and sold. The exhibition underscores Vollard\u2019s achievement in promoting careers and styles to collectors, art critics, and artists, who used his gallery as a meeting place to discuss and buy modern art. Special galleries devoted to individual artists feature works from Vollard\u2019s most important exhibitions, including paintings from his groundbreaking 1895 C\u00e9zanne show, a never-before reassembled triptych from Vollard\u2019s 1896 Van Gogh retrospective, and, from Gauguin\u2019s important 1898 exhibition of Tahitian works, the masterpiece Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? lent by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and on view for the first time ever in Chicago.\n\nThe exhibition also highlights Vollard\u2019s importance as a creative catalyst for artists who, in response to his urging, experimented in making a variety of artworks including color print albums, livres d\u2019artiste (limited-edition artists\u2019 books), sculpture, and decorated ceramics. The many and varied portraits of Vollard featured in the exhibition underscore his close relationships to artists and his brilliance as a self-promoter.",

  "title": "The Thrill of the Chase: The Harry B. and Bessie K. Braude Memorial Collection",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "This past summer, Boston collector Dorothy Braude Edinburg presented the Art Institute with an extraordinary gift of more than 600 prints, 190 drawings, 150 Chinese and Korean ceramics, and her collection of Japanese illustrated books. Given in memory of her parents, Harry B. and Bessie K. Braude, who instilled in her artistic interests and high standards, these remarkable works are a landmark gift\u2014not only for the museum but for all of Chicago. For the past 22 years, Edinburg has worked in active partnership with Art Institute curators both to bring the city the great works she has gathered throughout her life and to target and acquire new works for the museum\u2019s collection.\nThis exhibition features 97 drawings purchased by Edinburg for the museum since 1991, a treasure trove of works on paper from the 16th through the mid-20th century. Among the early Italian, French, and Spanish pieces is a rare, moving wash drawing, Sleeping Christ Child, by the popular Baroque artist Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo. A highlight of the early Northern schools, one of Edinburg\u2019s special interests, is Jacob Jordaens\u2019s eloquent Jacob and Esau. Works by Constable and Karl Friedrich Schinkel crown the assortment of British and German 19th-century works, while the 19th-century French collection boasts rich representation of Paul C\u00e9zanne, Edgar Degas, and Claude Monet. And finally the 20th-century masters on view include Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, Giorgio Morandi, Jean Metzinger, Pablo Picasso, and several German Expressionists. Chosen with Edinburg\u2019s unrelenting standards of condition, research, and scholarship, these drawings both effectively represent the essence of an artist\u2019s achievement and stand as significant, independent statements.\nSpeaking of her decades-long experience working with curators from the Department of Prints and Drawings, Edinburg remarked, \u201cWe have had tremendous fun together, enjoying the thrill of the chase and the entire process of determining the authenticity, condition, attribution, and importance of a drawing.\u201d That department\u2014and many others across the museum\u2014have enjoyed this rich relationship as well; not only has Edinburg greatly enhanced many collections but she has invigorated the museum with her acquisitive passion and enthusiastic spirit. With this most recent gift, intended as a public resource to inspire others, Chicago too shall be forever transformed by Edinburg\u2019s keen eye and great generosity.",

  "description": "Were the Impressionists fashionistas? And what role did fashion play in their goal to paint modern life with a \u201cmodern\u201d style? This is the subject of the internationally acclaimed exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity, the first to uncover the fascinating relationship between art and fashion from the mid-1860s through the mid-1880s as Paris became the style capital of the world. Featuring 75 major figure paintings by Caillebotte, Degas, Manet, Monet, Renoir, and Seurat, including many never before seen in North America, this stylish show presents a new perspective on the Impressionists\u2014revealing how these early avant-garde artists embraced fashion trends as they sought to capture modern life on canvas.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the modern fashion industry was born: designers like Charles Frederick Worth were transforming how clothing was made and marketed, department stores were on the rise, and fashion magazines were beginning to proliferate. Visual artists and writers alike were intrigued by this new industry; its dynamic, ephemeral, and constantly innovative qualities embodied the very essence of modernity that they sought to express in their work and offered a means of discovering new visual and verbal expressions.\n\nThis groundbreaking exhibition explores the vital relationship between fashion and art during these pivotal years not only through the masterworks by Impressionists but also with paintings by fashion portraitists Jean B\u00e9raud, Carolus-Duran, Alfred Stevens, and James Tissot. Period costumes such as men\u2019s suits, robes de promenade, day dresses, and ball gowns, along with fashion plates, photographs, and popular prints offer a firsthand look at the apparel these artists used to convey their modernity as well as that of their subjects. Further enriching the display are fabrics and accessories\u2014lace, silks, velvets, and satins found in hats, parasols, gloves, and shoes\u2014recreating the sensory experience that made fashion an industry favorite and a serious subject among painters, writers, poets, and the popular press.\n\nTruly bringing the exhibition to life are the vivid connections between the most up-to-the-minute fashions and the painted transformations of the same styles. Pairing life-size figure paintings by Monet, Renoir, or Tissot with the contemporary outfits that inspired them, the show invites inquiry into the difference between portrait and genre painting, between Tissot\u2019s painted fashion plates and Manet\u2019s images of life experienced, demonstrating for the first time the means by which the Impressionists \u201cfashioned\u201d their models\u2014and paintings\u2014for larger artistic goals.",

  "title": "Cauleen Smith: Human_3.0 Reading List",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Newspapers, magazines, and websites frequently offer lists: the 10 best new restaurants, the 50 top places to see in the world, the 100 best movies of all time. Chicago-based artist Cauleen Smith (American, born 1967) has created another kind of list, a new canon of humanistic literacy presented as a series of drawings. Titled Human_3.0 Reading List, the project represents a new dimension of Smith\u2019s work, one that engages with the idea of a collective consciousness through manually drawn renderings of book covers.\nIn this series of 57 drawings\u2014each produced on 8\u00bd \u00d7 12- inch graph paper in watercolor over graphite, occasionally elaborated with acrylic\u2014the artist proposes a selection of books that is both personal, conveyed by the frequent inclusion of fingers or a thumb shown holding up a given book, and idiosyncratic. Harriet Tubman, C. L. R. James, and bell hooks find their place alongside Starfish, Sea Urchins, and Their Kin by Nelson Herwig. Together the drawings ask challenging questions: Have you read these books? Will you read these books? What will they mean to you? What do they mean to us now? Which titles might be missing?\nAn artist whose primary discipline is film, Smith has incorporated various influences and references in her images\u2014science fiction, the black diaspora, and the lyrical potential of landscape. She first garnered national recognition with her feature-length film Drylongso (1998), which she completed during her graduate training at UCLA\u2019s film school. In 2010, Smith moved to Chicago, where her work has grown increasingly site-specific and engaged in social activism. She created the Solar Flare Arkestral Marching Band Project, which has organized flash-mob appearances of a marching band composed of youth groups from the city\u2019s South Side. This and other recent works have explicitly invoked the legacy of pioneering composer and performer Sun Ra, whose music and elaborate self-defining mythology also propelled the broader artistic movement of Afrofuturism.\nGrounded in a sober assessment of race relations and institutional power structures, Human_3.0 Reading List calls its viewers to prepare for social change through self-empowered education. In the final words of the manifesto accompanying the series, Smith exhorts her audience: \u201cLove. Resist. Read on. Right on.\u201d\nSponsors\nSupport for this exhibition is provided by the Print and Drawing Club of the Art Institute of Chicago.",

At the same time, it addresses emergent sociohistorical phenomena, especially the increase of tourism, which made the sea newly attractive to artists in the second half of the 19th century.",

  "title": "Provoke: Photography in Japan between Protest and Performance, 1960-1975",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The short-lived Tokyo magazine Provoke is now recognized as a major achievement in world photography of the last 50 years. Although it existed only for three issues and a mere nine months\u2014November 1968 through August 1969\u2014Provoke crystallized the best of progressive art photography and cultural criticism in Japan during the 1960s and early 1970s. The Provoke members\u2014Daid\u00f4 Moriyama, Takuma Nakahira, Takahiko Okada, Yutaka Takanashi, and K\u00f4ji Taki\u2014connected in their interests with the nationwide political protest movement, itself a terrific source for photography and photobooks in that time. Their work also dovetails with the rise of performance in Japanese fine art during the same years.\n\nThis exhibition is the first to provide a thorough history of the Provoke movement and to draw out the many connections between photography, political protest, and performance in postwar Japan. Suites of photographs and books by Nakahira, Takanashi, and Moriyama, the three main photographers of Provoke, anchor the show. Other important photographers with works on view include Sh\u00f4mei T\u00f4matsu, a mentor to many Provoke members; Eik\u00f4 Hosoe, the most internationally recognized photographer of the time; and Nobuyoshi Araki, who remains a popular and controversial figure today. An early happening by the Fluxus group Hi-Red Center; a street performance by actor and director Shuji Terayama; and a Conceptual Art series by K\u00f4ji Enokura and Jir\u00f4 Takamatsu bring the exhibition across disciplines and territories. Meanwhile, selections from a set of nearly 500 protest photographs and some 80 protest books represent vernacular creative work of the period.\n\nA major international traveling show, which has Chicago as its only North American venue, this exhibition is the first survey of postwar Japanese art to be organized at the Art Institute of Chicago and draws heavily on the the museum\u2019s collection\u2014more than 60% of the over 200 items on display belong to the Art Institute.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "From the mid-1960s, at a time when photography was commonly kept separate from the fine arts, a variety of artists associated with the nascent Conceptual Art movement began making and exhibiting photographic works as an integral contribution to debates about avant-garde painting and sculpture. Within a few years, their efforts had brought photography definitively into the mainstream of contemporary art.\nConceptual Art questioned habitual expectations of a work of art\u2014for example, that it should be singular and self-contained, or that it should emanate from an indescribable authorial sensibility. Uses of photography in the movement went hand in hand with an emphasis on art as information and on the roles played by spectators, critics, museums, and market values in validating the status of a work as art.\nConceptual photography also brought a new range of expression to progressive art, from humor to political critique, grounded in the mimicry of vernacular and commercial photographic genres. In exploring these areas, Conceptual artists helped to redefine the relationship of fine art to the broad public sphere of image creation and consumption.\nConceptual photography took many forms\u2014from photo-canvases and mixed-media sculptures to photobooks, magazine articles, slide and film projections, and postcards, as well as \"straight\" photographic prints shown singly or in series. It is this diversity of objects and presentation methods, rather than any fixed, categorical notion of photography or art in general, that is the lasting legacy of Conceptual Art: the establishment of contemporary art as a field without a medium.\nAs befits the presentation of this innovative exhibition, a special opening event occurred on Friday, December 9. Beginning at 6:00 p.m., the Art Institute projected Andy Warhol's 1964 film Empire\u2014a single, eight-hour-long nighttime take of the Empire State Building\u2014from the museum's Bluhm Family Terrace across Millennium Park to the upper stories of the Aon Center. Warhol's work thus set the stage for the artists featured in Light Years, who redrew the boundaries of both photography and contemporary art.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "After its widely popular debut in 2013, our spectacular 18th-century Neapolitan cr\u00e8che returns once again this holiday season. One of the very few and finest examples of such a work outside of Naples, the cr\u00e8che is an intricate Nativity scene that reflects the vitality and artisanship that the city is still known for. The Art Institute\u2019s cr\u00e8che features over 200 figures\u2014including no less than 50 animals and 41 items of food and drink\u2014all staged in a spectacular Baroque cabinet with a painted backdrop. Elaborate, complex, and wondrous, the Neapolitan cr\u00e8che is a rare example of the genre and a once-in-a-lifetime acquisition for the Art Institute.\n\nSacred imagery reenacting the Nativity has its roots in fourth-century Rome but by the 13th and 14th centuries, in part due to its association with St. Francis of Assisi, such scenes had become a permanent feature of Neapolitan churches. During the 18th century, the period from which most of the figures of the Art Institute\u2019s cr\u00e8che date, these relatively simple tableaux underwent a transformation into highly dramatic and theatrical renderings. Traditional sacred elements of Nativity scenes\u2014the Holy Family, wise men, angels, and shepherds\u2014were combined with profane aspects not of Bethlehem but of contemporary Neapolitan life\u2014rowdy tavern scenes and bustling street activities\u2014in dazzling displays of artistic techniques. Churches, wealthy citizens, members of the nobility, and the royal family all competed to commission the most complex presentations of this popular art form from leading artists and artisans, the same people who were creating monumental sculptures and altars for churches and palaces. These artists rendered figures in oil-painted terracotta to achieve the most realistic expressions in cr\u00e8ches and constructed painstakingly detailed costumes of luxurious fabrics that mimicked the fashions of the time. The Art Institute\u2019s cr\u00e8che represents the pinnacle of this artistic practice, born of the centuries-old tradition of Nativity scenes yet bursting with the energy of 18th-century Neapolitan life.\n\nDue to the fragility of the original silk costumes and exquisite embroidery, the Neapolitan cr\u00e8che can only be on view for a few weeks every year. Don\u2019t miss your chance to revel in Baroque artistry this season!\n\nSponsors\nThe Art Institute of Chicago is grateful to the following individuals for their generous support of the Neapolitan cr\u00e8che: The Nativity and Three Wise Men and Their Courts and Treasures sponsored by Mr. and Mrs. James N. Bay; The Heavenly Host sponsored by Linda and Vincent Buonanno and Family in memory of Vincent Buonanno Jr.; The Taverna sponsored by the Eloise W. Martin Legacy Fund; and La Georgiana and Her Companions sponsored by Mrs. Robert O. Levitt.",

  "description": "This exhibition showcases archival items linked to 8 women who were made significant contributions to the Art Institute, or who had a lifelong association with the museum or school. Three curators (Bessie Bennett, Katharine Kuh and Christa Mayer Thurman), three donors (Kate Buckingham, Annie Swan Coburn and Margaret Day Blake), one teacher/author (Helen Gardner) and one artist (Georgia O\u2019Keeffe) put their stamp on this institution, often without much fanfare or public recognition. Bessie Bennettt was the first female curator in a major museum in the United States, Helen Gardner wrote with her \u201cArt Through The Ages\u201d the first comprehensive art historical handbook, Annie Swan Coburn enriched the museum\u2019s permanent collection with a fabulous gift of first rate Impressionist paintings. Each of these women has a story to tell, of dedication, hardship, perseverance and success.",
