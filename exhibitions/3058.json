    "description": "Mariko Mori creates multimedia work that conceives of art, technology, and Buddhist spirituality as interconnected, unifying forces. In the 1990s she turned to fashion and science fiction as pop-cultural models to produce unsettling, high-gloss dreamscapes. \n\nStaged in Osaka\u2019s Kansai International Airport, the video Miko No Inori (The Shaman-Girl\u2019s Prayer) presents a calming but otherworldly vision. Mori stars as an extraterrestrial character: outfitted in a white, iridescent costume and wearing reflective, icy-blue contact lenses, she turns a crystal ball as if conjuring the future or caressing the object of her affection. A recording of the artist singing a haunting Japanese song (\u201cThe word is melting; the word is melting, becoming one\u201d) plays in the background. \n\nIn this work, Mori is not only an extraterrestrial, but also a shaman\u2014a person who acts as an intermediary between the earthly and spiritual realms.",
