    "is_featured": false,
    "description": "The most influential and enduring progressive printmaking collective of its time, the Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular (the Popular Graphic Art Workshop or TGP) created some of the most memorable images in mid-century printmaking. This Mexico City\u2013based workshop took up the legacy of the famous Mexican broadside illustrator Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada, creating prints, posters, and illustrated publications that were popular, affordable, legible, politically topical, and, above all, formally compelling. This exhibition includes over 100 works from the Art Institute\u2019s rich holdings\u2014one of the most significant TGP collections in the United States\u2014demonstrating why this collective boasted such international influence and inspired the establishment of print collectives around the world.\nFounded in 1937 by Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez, Luis Arenal, and American-born Pablo O\u2019Higgins, the TGP emerged and evolved in the crucible of antifascist and leftist politics in Mexico in the period surrounding World War II. This milieu shaped not only the workshop\u2019s dedication to a collective printmaking model but also its production aimed at both \u201cthe people\u201d and discerning collectors, a strategy necessitated by the era\u2019s quickly changing political tides. The collective created works for groups spanning the leftist and progressive political spectrum, including the government of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and his successors, the Mexican Communist Party, major trade unions, and antifascist organizations.\nDuring the TGP\u2019s heyday, from its founding until the 1950s, the workshop produced thousands of prints, primarily linocuts and lithographs, for everything from ephemeral handbills and newspapers to political and advertising posters to luxe portfolios and printed books. Favoring an expressive, realist visual language, its work addressed a wide range of socially engaged themes, including Mexican history and culture, political satires both local and international (including calavera broadsides), rural and urban scenes of daily life, and agitprop prints. The members of the workshop, a core of about 40 during its height, produced both individual and collective works and welcomed numbers of foreign members and guest artists\u2014from Elizabeth Catlett to Josef Albers\u2014to use the workshop in order to collaborate on prints and create individual pieces.\nShowcasing the TGP\u2019s prolific and varied output, What May Come is organized into thematic sections such as Chicago connections to the TGP, antifascism, national history, daily life, caricature, and popular visual traditions. A Spanish-English catalogue accompanies the exhibition, which also features bilingual labeling.",
