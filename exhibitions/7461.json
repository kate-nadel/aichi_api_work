    "description": "This exhibition of Hungarian metalwork from the Medieval and Modern departments of the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest illustrated characteristics of gold and silverwork in Hungary. Until the early 16th-century, about a third of the gold production in Europe came from Hungary, where artists were exposed to the styles of the major European capitals and those of the Ottoman east. The catalogue that accompanied the exhibition was the first major English-language work on Hungarian gold and silver.",
