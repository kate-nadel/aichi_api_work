    "description": "During November 1940, a late 15th century circular painting, known as \u2018tondo\u2019, depicting the visit of the Magi to the infant Christ from the Italian Renaissance was featured at the Masterpiece of the Month. Some of the interesting elements of this painting includes the range of different kinds of animals present and the ship on the left side of the composition, suggesting that the Magi either arrived or are set to depart by boat.\n\n*At the time of this exhibition in 1940, \u201cThe Adoration of the Magi\u201d was attributed to Francesco Botticini; it is now attributed to his son, Raffaello Botticini.",
