    "description": "This exhibit was inspired by \u201cA History of American Art Porcelain,\u201d which was published earlier that year and was written by Marvin D. Schwartz and Richard Wolfe. Over forty pieces were shown, all of which ranged from the 19th to 20th century. This exhibit aimed to shed light on \u201cone of the most neglected fields of Americana.\u201d The complexities of the porcelain making process and the inherent ties between porcelain and American history were heavily emphasized in this show. Items like tea sets, plates, pitchers, cups, vases, baskets, birds, animals, and busts were on view for visitors.",
