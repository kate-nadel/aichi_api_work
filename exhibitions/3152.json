    "description": "Zarina Bhimji\u2019s Out of Blue, one of the most critically celebrated artist\u2019s films of recent years, is an abstracted narrative of guilt, mourning, and loss, rooted in specific geopolitical, historical, and autobiographical facts. An artist of Indian descent, Bhimji was eight years old and living in Uganda with her family in 1972, the year General Idi Amin expelled tens of thousands of South Asians from the country. As a filmmaker, Bhimji registers impressions of present-day Uganda through light, color, and texture to bear witness to the recent past.",
