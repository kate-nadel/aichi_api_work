    "short_description": "The printing press came late to the Islamic world, in part because it was eclipsed by the popularity of elegant, handmade books that celebrate the beauty of the written word. This exhibition is a two-part series to explore the complex process of Islamic bookmaking with a selection of elegant manuscript pages, book bindings, and writers' tools from the Art Institute's collection.",
