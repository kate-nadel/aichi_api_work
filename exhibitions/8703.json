    "description": "Most years the annual American exhibition showcased a cross section of contemporary American art, spanning a wide array of artistic trends. In 1947-48 however, the exhibition was solely focused on Abstract and Surrealist art, produced within the last 5 years. Of the 252 artists in the show, 111 had never exhibited in a museum before. Curator Katharine Kuh gained international fame by making this show a reality.",
