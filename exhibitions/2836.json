    "description": "Special tickets ARE NOT required for this exhibition. Enjoy the exhibition during regular museum hours.\n\nThis major international exhibition provides a detailed survey of the art of Florence during the years that Michelangelo and artists employed by the first Medici grand dukes\u2014such as Cellini, Bronzino, and Pontormo\u2014produced celebrated masterpieces. Works by these artists bolstered the wordly power and status of the ruling family and reflected the sophistication and refinement of Florentine court circles, in which high value was placed upon classical aesthetics and scientific learning. Many of the 200 objects in the exhibition\u2014including sculpture, painting, armor, medals, porcelain, and tapestries\u2014have never before traveled out of Florence. Among the objects on view for the first time in the United States are three sculptures by Michelangelo, some of the greatest paintings of the Uffizi and Pitti Galleries, and works from the famed Studiolo (treasure room) of Francesco I in the Palazzo Vecchio.\n\nThe Medici, Michelangelo, and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence is the first major exhibition in North America devoted to this moment of great achievement and artistic innovation, one of the richest periods in the history of art. Before coming to the Art Institute, the exhibition opened at the Strozzi Palace in Florence. After leaving Chicago it will be seen at the Detroit Institute of Arts.\n\n\nCatalogue\nA fully illustrated, scholarly exhibition catalogue, published by the Yale University Press in association with the Detroit Institute of Arts, accompanies the show.\n\nCurators\nLarry Feinberg, Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Curator of European Painting, the Art Institute; Alan P. Darr, Walter B. Ford II Family Curator of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, the Detroit Institute of Arts; Marco Chiarini, director emeritus, Palazzo Pitti, Florence\n\n\nCollaborators\nThe Medici, Michelangelo, and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence was organized by The Detroit Institute of Arts, the Soprintendenza Speciale per il Polo Museale Fiorentino, and the Opificio delle Pietre Dure of Florence, Italy, with the close collaboration of the The Art Institute of Chicago and the Firenze Mostre, Florence.
