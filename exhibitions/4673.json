    "description": "Though titled after Albrecht Durer, this exhibit offered a look into the artist himself as well as his inspirations and contemporaries. The exhibit opened with three of Durer\u2019s great inspirations\u2014  Michael Wolgemut, Martin Schongauer, and the Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet, all of whom were masters of printmaking, engraving, or painting. In the exhibit, ample attention was paid to how Durer influenced fellow artists of his time through painting, architecture, printmaking, engraving, etching, goldsmithing, woodcuts, and stained glass windows. In order to convey the scope of Durer\u2019s mastery, a large range of drawings were selected to show everything from landscapes, dignified portraits of citizens, and imaginative portraits of saints and strange beasts. Further emphasis was placed on the many tools Durer used in creating his work, especially on the process of creating woodcuts. Over 150 master drawings were included in this exhibit.",
