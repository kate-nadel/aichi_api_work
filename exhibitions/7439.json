    "description": "In 1978, American photographer Richard Avedon was hired by the Amon Carter Museum to photograph a series of portraits capturing the spirit of the American West. Avedon traveled the west for five years, photographing subjects he met at ranches, state fairs, factories, rodeos, oil fields, mines, and roadside diners against a plain white backdrop. The 124 portraits that composed this exhibition were controversial, and the exhibition was one of the most highly attended exhibitions in the Amon Carter Museum's history before traveling to the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Phoenix Art Museum, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and the High Museum of Art.",
