    "description": "Full-color prints and nishiki-e, or brocade pictures, make up the majority of the Japanese woodblock prints known as ukiyo-e, or pictures of the floating world. This exhibition, however, explores the creativity involved in the lack of color in Japanese prints from the early period of ukiyo-e in the 17th century up to the present day.",
