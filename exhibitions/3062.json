    "description": "This intimate library exhibition explores Wright\u2019s relationship with and influence on early 20th-century Dutch avant-garde architecture. The editors and contributors to Wendingen, a magazine that ran from 1918 to 1932, saw in Wright the embodiment of their architectural goals: cohesive structures that seamlessly unite every aspect of a building\u2019s design. Over seven issues, Dutch architects and other of Wright\u2019s contemporaries praise him, his designs, and reveal to us their vision of a society as harmonious as the buildings it erects.",
