    "description": "This exhibition of teen art has been imagined, curated, designed, and installed by the Art Institute Teen Council, a group of 11 teens from all over Chicagoland, who have met here since October to find new ways for youth to engage with the museum. It tells the story of a journey to adulthood through the perspective of a teenager. The exhibition is categorized into four sub-themes that delineate aspects of this journey: origins, transitions, individuality, and interactions. For the exhibition, Teen Council members selected artwork that was created by teens around Chicago (and beyond) and represents various perspectives, subjects, media, and art-making techniques.",
