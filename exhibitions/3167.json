    "description": "Inspired by China\u2019s majestic mountains, selections from 400 years of Chinese painting display restless motion, cool detachment, or quiet retreat, and evoke the loftiest of human ideals.\n\nAmong all elements of China\u2019s spectacular topography, majestic mountains have provided the most compelling inspiration for centuries of creative painters. Whether quietly or dramatically expressive, these artists\u2019 multilayered compositions resonate with the complex patterns and textures of nature. They may embody restless motion, cool detachment, or quiet retreat, or even more subtly, evoke the loftiest of human ideals. The paintings exhibited here span the past 400 years and in their rhythmic energy, achieve lives of their own.",
