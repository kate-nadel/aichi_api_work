    "description": "This exhibition, the first in Chicago for painter Sean Scully, consisted of four of Scully\u2019s \"maximal minimalist\" paintings created over a five-year period starting in 1982. The paintings, which attempt to humanize abstraction, were displayed with pieces from the Art Institute's permanent collection by artists such as Henri Matisse and Frank Stella to emphasize the band or stripe that recurs throughout modern painting. Heart of Darkness, the earliest of Scully's works featured in the exhibition, is now in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, which was given the painting by the Society for Contemporary Art.",
