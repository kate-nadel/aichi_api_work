    "description": "Reconstructing Adler and Sullivan's Stock Exchange Trading Room\nRyerson & Burnham Libraries Reading Room\nDecember 16, 2019 through March 6, 2020 (weekdays only)\n\nThe Trading Room was the centerpiece of the Chicago Stock Exchange building, one of the most distinctive commercial structures built by the architectural firm of Dankmar Adler and Louis H. Sullivan. This exhibit explores that space\u2019s journey through changes in appearance and function as well as place. Drawing on the rich resources in the Ryerson and Burnham Archives and two private collections, the exhibit features architectural fragments from the Trading Room and adjacent spaces with press accounts, photographs, building plans, and correspondence to tell the story of the design, construction, remodeling, demolition, salvage operations, and eventual reconstruction of the space. Though the building was demolished in 1972, its exterior entrance arch and the Trading Room live on in reconstructed form at the Art Institute of Chicago. Visitors to this exhibition are encouraged to also view the reconstructed Trading Room on the east side of the museum near gallery 144. The entire room is treated as a work of art documenting Adler and Sullivan's innovations in structure and style that are characteristic of the Chicago School of Architecture.",
