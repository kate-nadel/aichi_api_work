    "description": "The new Modern Wing offers the museum\u2019s first state-of-the-art gallery dedicated solely to the exhibition of works in film, video, and new media. Generously supported by leading Chicago collectors Donna and Howard Stone, this gallery is located on the Modern Wing\u2019s first floor adjacent to the photography gallery. The first year of programming highlights four recent acquisitions that have yet to be displayed at the Art Institute.\n\nThe inaugural installation is Steve McQueen\u2019s Girls, Tricky, an intimate work from 2001 that portrays the experimental \u201ctrip-hop\u201d musician and producer Tricky as he rehearses a track in his dimly lit recording studio. London\u2013raised and Amsterdam\u2013based, McQueen is a prominent artist and filmmaker whose reductive, often abstracted works, pare down the projected image to its basic elements: light and dark, motion and stillness, silence and sound. The meanings in McQueen\u2019s intensely concentrated, exquisitely choreographed films and projected image installations are at once elusive, elliptical, and subtly transgressive.",
