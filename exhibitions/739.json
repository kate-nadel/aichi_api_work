    "description": "Mario Ybarra Jr. (b. 1973) is a visual and performance artist, educator and activist who combines street culture with fine art in order to produce what he calls \"contemporary art that is filtered through a Mexican-American experience in Los Angeles.\" This exhibition is a comparative study of Los Angeles and Chicago using as its base the chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. and his business ventures in both cities. Through extensive archival and anecdotal research, Ybarra will draw parallels between these two cities' cultural idiosyncrasies and similarities. The exhibition will consist of a satellite component, featuring an artist's multiple at Chicago's Wrigley Field, in addition to an installation at the museum including drawings and photographs by the artist, historical objects, and ephemera.\n\nThis exhibition is made possible by a grant from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Ongoing support for focus exhibitions is provided by the Alfred L. McDougal and Nancy Lauter McDougal Fund for Contemporary Art.",
