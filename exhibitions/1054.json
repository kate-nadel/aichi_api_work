    "description": "The Nobel Prize\u2013winning poet Octavio Paz once remarked that nations with a colonial past have the obligation to examine and acknowledge their ancient history as they advance into modernity. Attuned to Paz\u2019s directive, the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City, the Museo de Antropolog\u00eda de Xalapa, and the Art Institute of Chicago present an exhibition of sculptural masterpieces from Mexico\u2019s ancient civilizations to celebrate the bicentennial of Mexico\u2019s independence from Spain and the centennial of the 1910 Revolution, which led to the modern Mexican republic.\n\nSeventeen major works of ancient Pre-Columbian art reveal the distinctive styles and symbolic forms of different societies that flourished between 900 B.C. and A.D. 1521. While stylistically and conceptually diverse, these compelling objects share a fundamental worldview in which human society was perceived as an integral part of the dynamic order of nature. The universe was seen as reflections of relationships between life forces, and it was a primary purpose of art, architecture, and ritual drama to illustrate and certify that sacred integration.\n\nThe poetic title, Ballplayers, Gods, and Rainmaker Kings, alludes to the variety of images stemming from this governing principle of ancient life. Ancient ballgames were played not only for sport but as a form of divination; cosmic events were held to influence the outcome, and the interpretation of results in turn affected actions taken by rulers. The deities of ancient Mexico were also closely bound to this natural order\u2014to the land, crops, and the annual cycle of seasons\u2014while the kings\u2019 duties included ending the dry season with offerings and prayers upon the high mountains, calling for rain clouds to appear and initiate the annual cycle of renewal.\n\nThe exhibition is part of the citywide celebration of Mexico 2010, which opens September 15 with a performance of Mexican music and dance in Millennium Park\u2019s Pritzker Pavilion.",
