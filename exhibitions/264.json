    "description": "In 1887 Ambroise Vollard (1866\u20131939) arrived in Paris with few contacts and no credentials to pursue a career as an art dealer. He began representing artists that were undervalued, exhibiting them at a time when many galleries were not willing to take the risk. In 1895 Vollard hosted C\u00e9zanne\u2019s first solo exhibition, and in doing so he made the artist\u2019s reputation as well as his own.\n\nBy the early 20th century, Vollard had become the principal dealer of artists such as Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin, and a number of Fauve artists, and lent early support to artists who are well known today\u2014Pierre Bonnard, Aristide Maillol, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Edouard Vuillard\u2014as well as many who remain relatively unknown. His shrewd mind for business and artistic sense made him the leading contemporary art dealer of his generation.\n\nC\u00e9zanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde draws upon the dealer\u2019s archives\u2014handwritten sale and purchase records, stockbooks, photography, and correspondence\u2014to shed new light not only on Vollard\u2019s business strategies but also on the heretofore unexplored story of his relationships with artists whose work he exhibited and sold. The exhibition underscores Vollard\u2019s achievement in promoting careers and styles to collectors, art critics, and artists, who used his gallery as a meeting place to discuss and buy modern art. Special galleries devoted to individual artists feature works from Vollard\u2019s most important exhibitions, including paintings from his groundbreaking 1895 C\u00e9zanne show, a never-before reassembled triptych from Vollard\u2019s 1896 Van Gogh retrospective, and, from Gauguin\u2019s important 1898 exhibition of Tahitian works, the masterpiece Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? lent by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and on view for the first time ever in Chicago.\n\nThe exhibition also highlights Vollard\u2019s importance as a creative catalyst for artists who, in response to his urging, experimented in making a variety of artworks including color print albums, livres d\u2019artiste (limited-edition artists\u2019 books), sculpture, and decorated ceramics. The many and varied portraits of Vollard featured in the exhibition underscore his close relationships to artists and his brilliance as a self-promoter.",
