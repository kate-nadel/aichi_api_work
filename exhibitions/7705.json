    "description": "This traveling exhibition, sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, displayed a representative selection of the printmaking activities of the Pont Aven artists from approximately 1888 to 1895. Artists included Paul Gauguin, Emile Bernard, Paul Serusier and others, working in media that at the time was deemed minor. The works on display were compiled by the Swiss collector Samuel Josefowitz over thirty years, and the exhibition marked the first time they were displayed together as a group.",
