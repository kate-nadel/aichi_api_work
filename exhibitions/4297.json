    "description": "This exhibit celebrated the colorful career of Pierre Bonnard. Known as a father of the Nabis art movement and a forerunner in the French avant-garde, Bonnard focused on painting fin-de-siecle scenes of the pre-World War I French middle class. Though his works look Impressionistic in style, each one was executed with painstakingly close attention to detail, with excessive focus on form and color. In this exhibition, one could observe the development of Bonnard\u2019s technique and the change in palette over the sixty year spanse covered in the show.",
