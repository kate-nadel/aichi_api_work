    "description": "This exhibition of Newman's portrait photographs originated at the San Diego Museum of Photographic Arts before traveling to the Art Institute of Chicago. Tracing the photographer's work from his social documentary work of the late 1930s and early 1940s to contemporary works using collage techniques, the show displayed more than 100 artworks. Portraits of Max Ernst, Pablo Picasso, Martha Graham, and Robert Oppenheimer showed the artist's talent for \"environmental portraiture,\" or capturing the personality of his subjects by depicting them in their own spaces rather than in a studio.",
