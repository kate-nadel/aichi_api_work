    "description": "Elizabeth Catlett (b. 1915) is a printmaker, sculptor, and artist who has had an undeniable influence in the art world through her dedication to social justice, women's rights, and advocacy for literacy. Influenced by the principal participants of the Harlem Renaissance as well as artists of the Mexican muralist tradition, she ascribed to the ideal that art could and should play a role in the transformation of society. This exhibition focuses on five new acquisitions from Catlett's early career, including three works from her celebrated porfolio \"I Am the Black Woman\" (1946-47).",
