    "description": "This de Stael retrospective was organized internationally by five museums. Originally the Museum Boysmans-Van Beuningen and Kunsthaus in Zurich were collaborating on an exhibition, but when they learned of plans at The Art Institute of Chicago, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, they quickly decided to collaborate. As a result, a large stretch of Nicolas de Stael\u2019s relatively short-lived life was represented through 118 his works in this exhibit. Widely regarded as a 20th century master, de Stael\u2019s lyrically abstract works were influenced by the likes of Rembrandt, Vermeer, Matisse, and Braque. His initial exploration of naturalistic landscapes eventually drove him towards abstraction. In his later career, it is evident that de Stael pursued a less representational form of painting that derived influence from the real world. For example, some of the paintings on view in this exhibit were inspired by music, sports, art, and even food. Eventually, de Stael achieved a sense of clarity in his more mature works, which focused on the poetics of forms and additional defining visual values.",
