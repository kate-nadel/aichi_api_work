    "description": "This exhibition included over sixty textiles selected from the museum\u2019s permanent collection; they were primarily produced and manufactured in England and France between the 1770s and 1830s. During this period, a far larger segment of the population had access to these fabrics because the natural-colored, plain-woven cloth available for them was less expensive than the silk and velvet fabrics used in past centuries. Pieces such as the ones exhibited were used as fabrics for bed hangings, upholstery, wall coverings, and window curtains. The textiles in the exhibition were further supplemented with original engravings in books and independently issued prints used in the creation of such works. This exhibition was a sequel to \u201cEnglish and French Printed Textiles\u2014History on Cloth,\u201d which took place from May 1 to August 11, 1991.",
