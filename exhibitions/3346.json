    "description": "Held annually for over a century, the American Paintings and Sculpture shows offered an important exhibition opportunity for the most distinguished American artists working both at home and abroad. These exhibitions, by invitation only, were judged by a jury of artists, who selected the works to be displayed and awarded several prizes to works in the show. In 1930 a new painting by Iowa artist Grant Wood, an alumnus of the School of the Art Institute, was shown for the first time. American Gothic was awarded the Norman Waite Harris Bronze Medal, and the museum promptly purchased the work for its permanent collection.",
