    "description": "Spirit into Matter: The Photographs of Edmund Teske showcases the work of this significant but largely unheralded photographer. A native of Chicago, Edmund Teske began his career in the city in the 1930s. Inspired by the avant-garde photography of Man Ray and others, Teske soon learned how to manipulate and transform his photographs in the darkroom. He created images that reveal the power of memory and dreams to transform our perception of the visual world. Spirit into Matter establishes Teske as one of the most innovative forces in 20th-century American photography.\n\nOrganizer\nSpirit into Matter: The Photographs of Edmund Teske has been organized by the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles.\n\nCurator\nJulian Cox, associate curator, the J. Paul Getty Museum. In Chicago, the exhibition is coordinated by Katherine Bussard, assistant curator of photography, the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSponsor\nThe Chicago presentation of Spirit into Matter is generously supported by The Comer Foundation.",
