    "description": "David Travis, Curator of Photography at the Art Institute of Chicago, selected these photographs from an archive of photographs formerly owned by Walker Evans to complement the Art Institute's holdings of the photographer's work. The photographs were then donated to the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago by Mr. and Mrs. David C. Ruttenberg through the Ruttenberg Arts Foundation. The title of the exhibition comes from a statement made by Walker Evans to describe his work during a 1967 interview with the New York Times: \"There is a deep beauty in things as they are.\" Evans took these photographs on assignment for Fortune Magazine and the Farm Security Administration.",
