    "description": "This exhibition of a private collection was selected by Alfred H. Barr, the director at the Museum of Modern Art in New York at the time of the exhibition. In his foreword written in the catalog for the show, he remarks on the high-quality works the Hellers have chosen to collect from major American artists such as Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman. Because the Hellers had collected such an extraordinary amount of 20th Century American art, they were often sought out by the several museums in New York and abroad for loans, a true testament to their remarkable selections of work. Among the many works exhibited in this show, many of them were major Abstract Expressionist works.",
