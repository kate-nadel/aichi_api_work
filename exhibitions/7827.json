    "description": "This exhibition was the first in the United States devoted to the work of Caspar David Friedrich. At the time, there was only one painting by the artist in the U.S.: Mountain Peak with Drifting Clouds, acquired by the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, in 1984. This exhibition contained more than a dozen works by this master of German Romanticism, loaned by State Hermitage Museum and the Pushkin Museum in the U.S.S.R., the only country outside Germany with major holdings of the artist\u2019s work.",
