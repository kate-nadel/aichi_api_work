    "description": "\u201cA noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency.\u201d Architect Daniel Burnham\u2019s words are certainly prophetic of his masterful and monumental 1909 Plan of Chicago. This urban-planning document, unprecedented in size and scope, created city treasures still cherished today\u2014the string of stunning lakefront parks, suburban forest preserves, the wide boulevard of North Michigan Avenue, the bi-level Wacker Drive, and a broadened Congress Parkway. The plan\u2019s legacies, however, are more than simply physical; Burnham promoted innovative concepts that remain goals for Chicago\u2019s vibrant future, including weaving the city into the regional fabric and creating abundant public spaces to foster community.\n\nYet, Burnham was as savvy as he was visionary. Knowing his plans would need convincing images to garner support, he engaged noted artists to produce 142 new illustrations. Maps, diagrams, perspective drawings, and even striking watercolors gloriously realize Burnham\u2019s ideas.\n\nThis exhibition, presented in conjunction with the citywide celebration of the Burnham Plan Centennial, presents 32 of these prized illustrations from the Department of Architecture and Design\u2019s collection in five separate and insightful rotations. The exhibition offers an extraordinary opportunity to view these historically significant and artistically exceptional documents that, because of their fragility, are rarely displayed publicly.",
