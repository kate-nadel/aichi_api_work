    "description": "Anne Imhof is one of the most important and pioneering artists of her generation, as her work establishes a new paradigm for performance art and gives form and voice to the lingering alienation that is so tangible in contemporary society. In Imhof\u2019s durational performance and installation projects, the complex of technology, isolation, and identity is manifested in both the bodies of the performers and the architecture of the installation. Glass partitions, steel constructions, and uncanny structures become the arena in which a choreographed group of performers and musicians exist, both detached from each other and moving in unison. \n\nHer work Faust was presented in the German Pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennial in 2017, for which she was awarded the prestigious Golden Lion, and her groundbreaking installation Angst was shown at Kunsthalle Basel and Hamburger Bahnhof in 2016. At the Art Institute\u2014for her first solo museum exhibition in the United States\u2014Imhof builds on the aesthetic of these previous projects and combines music, choreography, painting, and sculpture to stage a new installation commissioned specifically for the museum.",
