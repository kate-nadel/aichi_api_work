    "description": "Vancouver-based artist Rodney Graham is known for many roles\u2014musician, performer, philosopher, scientist, and writer\u2014but he is perhaps most recognized for his cerebral and captivating moving-image installations.\n\nTorqued Chandelier Release (2005) is the third in a trio of films that the artist describes as \u201cillustrated \u2018thought experiments\u2019 documenting transitory lighting events within the context of a single roll of film.\u201d Inspired by Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s famous water-bucket experiment exploring rotational motion, Torqued Chandelier Release vividly demonstrates Newton\u2019s investigations as the chandelier, wound-up off-camera and then released, spins in one direction then reverses course until it finally comes to rest. The dizzying image of the spinning fixture takes on a sculptural, three-dimensional appearance, echoing Newton\u2019s original experiment and illuminating the values of the Enlightenment itself.",
