    "description": "This exhibit focused on the happenings of Nazi-Occupied Germany in the 1930s, documenting the attacks on and destruction of over 16,000 museum acquisitions. In particular, this exhibit investigated works of artists who were included in the 1937 \u201cDegenerate Art\u201d or \u201cEntarte Kunst\u201d show, in which Nazis publicly condemned, mocked and defamed artists and writers whose ideas were out of line with the Nazi party. While many works in the original exhibition were either lost or destroyed, the Art Institute's iteration of the show held over 150 works featured in the original exhibit. Some major artists included in this show were Max Beckmann, Ernst Kirchner, Oskar Kokoschka, Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Marc Chagall, Georges Braque, Emil Nolde, and Lyonel Feininger.",
