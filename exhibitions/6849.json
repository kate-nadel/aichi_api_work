    "description": "The two concurrently held exhibitions at the Art Institute and the Newberry Library explored the history of both art and\ncartography. A key focus was on the advances of creativity in each field and the means by which each attempted to convey conceptions of reality effectively. The exhibitions on Art\nand Cartography were designed to illuminate the topic of the Sixth Kenneth Nebenzahl, Jr. Lectures at the Newberry Library. Pieces on display at the Art Institute of Chicago in the\nBlake-Palmer and Clarence Buckingham Galleries were from the Department of Prints and Drawings supplemented by loans from The Newberry Library, The Adler Planetarium, The American Geographical Society at The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Library, and private collectors and galleries. In addition to maps dating from the 15th century, scientific instruments, panoramas, schemes, and map-inspired art were also included.",
