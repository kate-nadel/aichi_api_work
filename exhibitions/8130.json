    "description": "The exhibition was shown only at the Art Institute, which held the largest collection of Monet\u2019s work outside of Paris and Boston. At the time, this exhibition was a comprehensive representation of Monet\u2019s career and the largest exhibition devoted to the artist; it aimed to include the best pieces from every period of Monet\u2019s working life. The show included 159 works from around the globe, both from museums and private collections. Sixty-six institutions and 37 private collections contributed paintings to the exhibition. Some highlights included the rarely loaned water-lily triptych from the museum of Modern Art, New York; The Carnegie Museum of Art\u2019s Water Lily Garden; seven of the Houses of Parliament Series done during the artist\u2019s stay in London; and the central panel of Luncheon on the Grass, which had never been exhibited outside Europe. The exhibition was extremely popular, and exceeded museum projections with 964,895 total visitors.",
