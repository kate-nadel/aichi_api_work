    "description": "In just a little over a decade, Chicagoan and Art Institute of Chicago trustee Irving Stenn Jr. has amassed a compelling collection of 170 drawings by at least 90 artists.\n\nConcentrating on works from the 1960s\u2014a period that saw a fundamental change in the way works on paper were made, used, and appreciated\u2014Stenn\u2019s stunning collection features multiple works by Mel Bochner, Sol LeWitt, Brice Marden, and Fred Sandback, along with pieces by Agnes Denes, Eva Hesse, Jasper Johns, Donald Judd, and Ellsworth Kelly. This focused assembly of 130 works, 100 of which are promised gifts to the museum, not only showcases Stenn\u2019s personal taste, vision, and passion as a collector but also offers a window into an era when artists reconsidered and reinvented the medium of drawing.\n\nStenn and his wife, Marcia, began collecting art\u2014bold contemporary prints, paintings, and sculpture\u2014in 1971. Yet it wasn\u2019t until 1999, after his wife passed away, that Stenn gravitated to drawings, which appealed to him because they are the most intimate and raw visualization of an artist\u2019s thought process. Their smaller scale also allows a greater number to remain on display at once\u2014significant as Stenn lives with his entire collection. Most importantly, however, his collecting pursuit has afforded Stenn close personal relationships in the drawing community, such as his friendship with Mel Bochner, which in turn have provided him with a thorough education and awareness of the broader sweep of art history.\n\nThough Stenn did not set out to create a specific narrative with his collection, he was drawn to artworks from the 1960s and enjoyed tracing influences to earlier pieces including those by Suprematist Kazimir Malevich and David Smith. His resulting assemblage highlights a definitive shift in artists\u2019 approach to drawings. While continuing the early modern practice of making drawings as finite expressions in their own right, innovators of the 1960s also frequently employed drawing in ways not previously considered art\u2014for example, as diagrams, instructions for fabrication, caprices suggesting movement in performance, markers of space and time, or notes made during lectures. Such works enabled spatial and tactile perception to be recorded or  conceptual concerns of a larger project to be explored, and these ideas, evidenced in a focus on the grid, inform many of the drawings in Stenn\u2019s collection.",
