    "description": "This exhibition of more than 200 works from Turkish, European, and American museums traveled to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Sultan Suleyman I (1494-1566) was a poet and patron of the arts who personally supervised the design for his royal mosque in Isanbul and oversaw the works of the imperial painting studio. Works from Suleyman's imperial painting studio, imperial wardrobe, royal pottery, and sultan's treasury were exhibited in the United States for the first time in this exhibition, alongside illuminated manuscripts, carpets, tiles, and armor.",
