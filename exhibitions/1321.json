    "description": "Painting and photography blossomed into fully corollary practices not long after photography\u2019s invention was announced in 1839. That fruitful relationship is exemplified by a group of works made in France\u2019s Barbizon region.\n\nEasily accessible by train from Paris as early as 1849, the Barbizon and its Forest of Fontainebleau flourished as a destination, and the inspiring rural landscape fostered a collegial atmosphere. Photographers, often trained as painters, composed images in response to oil sketches or drawings made outdoors or en plein air. Simultaneously, painters began using naturalistic photographs as aides-m\u00e9moire for future canvases. More realistic than sketches and more reproducible than paintings, photographs enjoyed wide circulation, popularizing and echoing compositions from the 1850s and 1860s by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, while inspiring others by the likes of Camille Pissarro in the 1870s.",
