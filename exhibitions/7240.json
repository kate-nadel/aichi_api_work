    "description": "In 1939, right before the outbreak of WWII and the German occupation of France, the French government had sent a large loan collection from the Louvre and 20 other French museums, as well as from numerous private collectors, to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Transatlantic art transports were halted during the war years, and the collection was temporarily stored in San Francisco. The Art Institute was the only US museum to undertake a display of the entire collection of these French masterpieces, in the spring of 1941.",
