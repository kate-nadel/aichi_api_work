    "description": "During January 1940, a woodblock print of Kabuki actor, \u201cIchikawa Omezo, as Ippei, a Man Servant,\u201d by Japanese ukiyo-e artist Toshusai Sharaku was featured as Masterpiece of the Month. Much of the details of Sharaku\u2019s life remains unknown, along with his true identity. There have been many theories about who Toshusai Sharaku; perhaps he was a Noh actor or maybe Sharaku was one of the many pseudonyms used by Hokusai. However, there hasn\u2019t been enough evidence clearly supporting any of these theories. What is certain is that Sharaku\u2019s expressive and bold portraits of Kabuki actors have influenced many artists and have appealed to many art enthusiasts.",
