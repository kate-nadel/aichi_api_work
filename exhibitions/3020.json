    "description": "This exhibition showcases archival items linked to 8 women who were made significant contributions to the Art Institute, or who had a lifelong association with the museum or school. Three curators (Bessie Bennett, Katharine Kuh and Christa Mayer Thurman), three donors (Kate Buckingham, Annie Swan Coburn and Margaret Day Blake), one teacher/author (Helen Gardner) and one artist (Georgia O\u2019Keeffe) put their stamp on this institution, often without much fanfare or public recognition. Bessie Bennettt was the first female curator in a major museum in the United States, Helen Gardner wrote with her \u201cArt Through The Ages\u201d the first comprehensive art historical handbook, Annie Swan Coburn enriched the museum\u2019s permanent collection with a fabulous gift of first rate Impressionist paintings. Each of these women has a story to tell, of dedication, hardship, perseverance and success.",
