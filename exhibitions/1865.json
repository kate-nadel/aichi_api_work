    "description": "Vincent van Gogh\u2019s bedroom in Arles is arguably the most famous chambre in the history of art. It also held special significance for the artist, who created three distinct paintings of this intimate space from 1888 to 1889. This exhibition\u2014presented only at the Art Institute of Chicago\u2014brings together all three versions of The Bedroom for the first time in North America, offering a pioneering and in-depth study of their making and meaning to Van Gogh in his relentless quest for home.\n\nVan Gogh painted his first Bedroom just after moving into his beloved \u201cYellow House\u201d in Arles, France, in 1888. He was so enamored with the work, now in the collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, that after water damage threatened its stability, he became determined to preserve the composition by painting a second version while at an asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my in 1889. Identical in scale and yet distinct from the original, that second work is now one of the icons of the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection. Van Gogh created a smaller third version, now at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris, as a gift for his mother and sister a few weeks after making the second. While the three paintings at first appear almost identical, when examined closely, each reveals distinct and unique details.\n\nThis exhibition is the first to truly delve into the fascinating history of these three paintings. Beginning with Van Gogh\u2019s early canvases of cottages and birds\u2019 nests, the show explores the artist\u2019s use of the motif of home\u2014as haven, creative chamber, and physical reality\u2014and follows the evolution of this theme throughout his career, beyond the Yellow House to the asylum at Saint-R\u00e9my. The presentation concludes with Van Gogh\u2019s final residence in Auvers-sur-Oise, where he once again painted a series of cottages\u2014returning to the idea that first evoked in him a sense of home.\n\nVan Gogh\u2019s Bedrooms features approximately 36 works by the artist, including paintings, drawings, and illustrated letters, as well as a selection of books and other ephemera known to have been in Van Gogh\u2019s possession. Enhancing the exploration of the artist\u2019s works and his longing for a place of his own are several engaging interactive presentations. A digitally enhanced reconstruction of his bedroom allows viewers the chance to experience his state of mind and the physical reality of the space that so inspired him, while other enriching digital components bring to light significant recent scientific research on the three Bedroom paintings. The result is an innovative yet intimate look at one of the most beloved and often-misunderstood artists of all time.\n\nSponsors\nLead support has been provided by the Estate of Jacquet McConville.\n\nMajor support has been generously provided by Caryn and King Harris, The Harris Family Foundation; the Gilchrist Foundation; The Morris and Dolores Kohl Kaplan Fund; and Evonne and John Yonover. \n   \nAdditional funding has been contributed by Constance and David Coolidge, the Mason Foundation, Charlene and Mark Novak, and the Comer Family Foundation. \n \nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v.S. Levy, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, Betsy Bergman Rosenfield and Andrew M. Rosenfield, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, and the Woman\u2019s Board.\n\nThe exhibition is supported by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.",
