    "description": "During October 1939, a painting by prominent seventeenth century French classical artist Nicolas Poussin titled \u201cLandscape with Saint John on Patmos\u201d was displayed as Masterpiece of the Month. As described by the newsletter announcing its exhibition, in this composition \u201cPoussin has paid more attention to the setting and the style. The Apostle, writing his book of Revelation, with the eagle (his symbol) almost lost in the shadow beside him, draws little attention to himself. One is more interested by the horizontal frontal platform\u2014a spacious stage on which the actors pose.\u201d",
