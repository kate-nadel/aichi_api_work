    "description": "The 1934 Century of Progress art exhibition varied greatly from the previous year\u2019s display. A greater emphasis was placed on exhibiting works by contemporary American artists, as well as the growing permanent collection of the Art Institute itself. The chronologically and stylistically organized exhibition had a lasting impact on the display methodology of the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection, as from then on works of art would no longer be displayed according to donor collections, but rather in an encyclopedic, chronological manner.",
