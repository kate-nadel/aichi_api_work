    "description": "This exhibit was considered a sequel to a Matisse retrospective held in 1951-1952 by the Museum of Modern Art. The contents of the show featured Matisse\u2019s gouache works, which was a medium he did not explore until he was in his sixties. His experimentation with the large, flat shapes explored placement of forms within linear and voluminous relationships.",
