    "description": "For the past five years Richard Misrach, renowned color photographer of the desert, has worked on a series of pictures of beaches, the ocean, sunbathers, and swimmers. Dramatically scaled and shot from above, the photographs envelop the viewer with a strangely disorienting perspective and hint at the sublime.\n\nThis exhibition was organized by the Art Institute of Chicago. This exhibition is made possible by David Yurman and the Black Dog Fund.",
