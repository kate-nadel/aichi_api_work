    "description": "Vincent Willem Van Gogh, son of Theo and nephew of the artist, inherited more than 600 works by Van Gogh (and a few by Gauguin) from his parents. He kept the collection together, on occasion lending a few works for special exhibitions. To this end the Art Institute director Daniel Catton Rich visited him in the late 1940s, and the two developed a close friendship. Together they visited many of the sites where Van Gogh had lived and made his paintings. They worked out an agreement for the Art Institute to borrow a large number of paintings and drawings, including all the best known works, for a full scale retrospective exhibition of Van Gogh in Chicago in 1950. In 1973 custody of the entire collection was transferred to the new Van Gogh Museum, a joint initiative by the Dutch government and the Van Gogh Family Foundation.",
