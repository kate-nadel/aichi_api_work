    "description": "This show, which included ninety original paintings, was the first major travelling exhibition of the original, large-scale watercolors John James Audubon painted for The Birds of America. After beginning with static depictions of birds in profile, in the style of eighteenth-century naturalists, Audubon began to depict birds in motion and experiment with a variety of media, including watercolor, gouache, and oil. In his mature works, he often combined many techniques and media for a single image: graphite strokes on wings to lend iridescence or blended pastel that suggested the soft texture of feathers. The exhibition also examined the engraving and hand coloring undertaken by Robert Havell, Jr. and his assistants to turn Audubon\u2019s immense watercolors (life-sized, even for large birds) into prints. The exhibition traced this process through a sequence showing an engraved copperplate, uncolored and unfinished prints, and a complete bound volume of the \u201cDouble Elephant\u201d folio of The Birds of America, so named for its exceptional size. In addition to the Art Institute of Chicago, this exhibition was on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Memphis Beooks Museum of Art, the New-York Historical Society, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.",
