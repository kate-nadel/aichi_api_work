    "description": "Painting, photography, film, sculpture, advertising, product design, theater sets\u2014L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy (American, born Hungary, 1895\u20131946) did it all. Future Present, the first comprehensive retrospective of Moholy-Nagy\u2019s work in the United States in nearly 50 years, brings together more than 300 works to survey the career of a multimedia artist who was always ahead of his time. Moholy, as he was known, came to prominence as a professor at the Bauhaus art school in Germany (1923\u201328). In 1937 he founded the New Bauhaus in Chicago, a school that continues today as the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology. He remains the most renowned international modern artist ever to have resided in Chicago.\n\nA pioneer of abstraction for the industrial age, Moholy insisted that art must be developed from the materials of one\u2019s time, in his case recorded sound, photography, film, and synthetic plastics. He demonstrated that in our era of reproducibility works of art gain fresh meaning with a change in size or even reorientation, reverse printing, or a shift in lighting. For Moholy, every citizen could be creative, and every viewer could educate his or her senses by studying effects of light, transparency, and motion in common materials of everyday modern life.\n\n\u2028Future Present presents a wide body of works ranging in date from 1920, when the artist moved to Germany, until his death in Chicago in 1946. One room shows 38 photomontages\u2014nearly all known compositions in nearly every physical variant\u2014brought together for the first time. Another presents three \u201ctelephone paintings,\u201d a single abstract composition that Moholy ordered in three sizes from an enamel sign factory in 1923; this trio of industrial paintings has been separated for decades. All six of Moholy\u2019s iconic, plunging views from the Berlin Radio Tower are united in another room, while a multimedia installation, Room of the Present, which Moholy conceived in 1930 but could not finish, is brought to life as a room of its own.\n\n\u2028\u2028Special emphasis is given to Moholy\u2019s time in the United States, where his art moved from planar painterly abstractions to three-dimensional hybrids of painting and sculpture. Never have so many of the artist\u2019s late works in Plexiglas\u2014wall-mounted, freestanding, and hanging in midair\u2014been seen together. These works came from Moholy\u2019s teaching at the \u201cChicago Bauhaus,\u201d which is also highlighted through a showing of student work as well as a \u201cteaching wall\u201d that frames Moholy\u2019s greatest pedagogical ideas. The show closes with Moholy\u2019s recorded voice and a projection of abstract color slides that the artist made in part by recording the scribble-like trace of headlights and taillights on Lake Shore Drive at night.\n\nOrganizers\nMoholy-Nagy: Future Present is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; and Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles.\n\nOther Venues\nSolomon R.
