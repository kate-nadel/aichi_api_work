He chose and commented on the works highlighted in this installation, discussing their shapes, textures, materials, and histories, as well as charts their points of intersection with his own creative interests and processes. The selection includes works from South Africa, Ghana, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, and Tanzania.",
