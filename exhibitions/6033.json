    "description": "This exhibit examined the ground-breaking work of Claude Nicolas Ledoux, \u00c9tienne-Louis Boullee, Jean-Jacques Lequeu, and Louis-Jean Desprez, who were all mid-to-late 18th century French architects. In the show, architectural feats were shown through photographs, aquatints, engravings, water-color drawings, and ink drawings. The exhibit aimed to show the ways in which neoclassical French architecture revolutionized the field, and offered an in-depth look into the skills of each architect and draughtsman.",
