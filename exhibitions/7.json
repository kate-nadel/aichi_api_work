    "description": "This exhibition celebrates a major gift to be known as the Harry B. and Bessie K. Braude Memorial Collection, which comprises 240 drawings promised or already given to the museum by Dorothy Braude Edinburg. Drawings in Dialogue highlights 166 of the works, including important examples by Renaissance and Baroque masters, fine drawings by 18th- and early 19th-century European and American artists, a stellar display of 19th-century French works, and a superb representation of early 20th-century art.\n\nAs a collector, Dorothy Edinburg is interested above all in acquiring drawings that represent the essence of an artist's achievement--powerful images that are significant, independent statements. Focusing on a work's primacy within an artist's career as well as on its authenticity and condition, Edinburg has amassed a collection of stunning breadth and quality. Her holdings have improved our understanding not only of the oeuvres of individual artists--their thought processes, working methods, and development--but also of relationships among contemporaries. Moreover, each drawing resonates meaningfully with other works in the Art Institute's collection.\n\nCatalogue\nIn conjunction with the exhibition, the Art Institute presents a beautifully illustrated, 224-page catalogue. An introduction by exhibition curator Suzanne Folds McCullagh traces the collection's history, provides an overview of its importance, and details its relationship to the museum's holdings. Each of the 166 drawings included is reproduced in full color and is accompanied by an informative, accessible entry. Presented in pairs, the drawings invite comparison, creating both a visual and intellectual dialogue for the reader. The catalogue will be available in the Museum Shop in late June.\n\nOrganizer\nThis exhibition is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nCurator\nSuzanne McCullagh, Anne Vogt Fuller and Marion Titus Searl Curator of Earlier Prints and Drawings\n\nSponsor\nThis exhibition is made possible through a generous anonymous gift. Additional support has been provided by the Rhoades Foundation/Julius Lewis Exhibition Endowment Fund. The catalogue is made possible by the Kemper Educational and Charitable Trust.",
