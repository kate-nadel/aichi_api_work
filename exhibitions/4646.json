    "description": "Art Israel was an exhibit that held the works of 26 modern Israeli artists. Themes of the art shown focused largely on Jewish identity and tradition, and celebratory nationalism. In preparing the exhibition, curator William C. Seitz omitted certain popular artists, choosing instead to focus on works by younger generations of native-born Israelites. The exhibition was organized by the Museum of Modern Art, but received further assistance from the America-Israel Cultural Foundation, and the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art.",
