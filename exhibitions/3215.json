    "description": "This focused exhibition threads together eight works that visually register the sweeping economic, material, social, and political changes that took place across the African continent during the early to mid-20th century. As artworks of the modern age, these objects each tell an individual story of local tradition and artistic response to the rapidly changing environment. The works also underline the extent of African artists\u2019 perception of and participation in an emerging globalized network of images, goods, new materials, and technologies.",
