    "description": "During June 1940, a series of paintings depicting a monk overcoming an attack by an infamous bandit by Goya, a Spanish Romantic painter, was featured as Masterpiece of the Month. With these paintings, Goya captured the highlights of a real-life event that took place during his time in Spain. In 1806, a bandit known as El Margato attempted to take the keys to the treasury from monk Pedro de Zaldivia. The monk was able to overcome and incapacitate the bandit. According to the newsletter announcing this exhibition, Pedro de Zaldivia was rewarded by Charles IV with a pension of 8,000 reales. The incident was publicized and celebrated by poets, musicians, writers, and visual artists; it most certainly captured the attention of Goya.",
