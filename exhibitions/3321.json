    "description": "Tagore is part of a long and distinguished tradition of writers whose expression extended beyond the page and across media. For many fellow writers and indeed Nobel laureates, the visual arts seemed to be an alternate mode of expression, often explored later in life. Nobel Prize\u2013winning authors William B. Yeats, Hermann Hesse, and G\u00fcnter Grass found drawing and painting to be enriching and complementary activities to their writing.\nTagore did not discover his affinity for painting until 1924, when he was in his mid-60s. His artistic practice grew out of his habits as a writer and poet; doodles and erasures sketched on his manuscripts blossomed into fantastic animals, figures, and scenes. Tagore's cross-cultural encounters during his many trips abroad influenced his visual art\u2014tribal artifacts of the Pacific, ancient bronzes from China, arts and crafts of Japan, and European modernism are all evident. By incorporating these various motifs and styles, he created images\u2014rhythmically articulated pictorial forms\u2014he felt were universal. He believed that while his music and writing were primarily for Bengal and India, his paintings\u2014free from the limitations of language\u2014were for the whole world.\nThe Art Institute is pleased to join the celebrations of Tagore's 150th birthday by bringing The Last Harvest: Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore to Chicago. Co-organized by the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, and the Ministry of Culture of the Government of India, this is the first major traveling exhibition from India to be exhibited at the Art Institute and presents a stunningly beautiful visual introduction to one of India's most highly regarded writers and artists.",
