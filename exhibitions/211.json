    "description": "Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre\nJuly 16\u2013October 10, 2005\nRegenstein Hall\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864\u20131901), one of the most popular and important painters of late-19th-century Paris, has not been the subject of a major exhibition since the large retrospective presented in London and Paris in 1991 and 1992. The National Gallery of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago have collaborated to organize Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre, an exhibition that places the artist's work at the peak of his career between 1888 and 1896 in conjunction with the work of other artists of the period. Toulouse-Lautrec and his contemporaries produced images that evocatively record the social geography of Montmartre, Paris' center of licit and illicit entertainment. Taking Montmartre as a state of mind as well as an environment, the exhibition reevaluates the decadent worldview of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris. The focus is on several Montmartre establishments, including dance halls, the circus, and maisons closes (a French euphemism for brothels), and the installation integrates major avant-garde paintings, topographical canvases, and posters and caricatures of stars such as Aristide Bruant and Lo\u00efe Fuller.\n\nThe aim of the exhibition is to place Toulouse-Lautrec in a wider cultural context and to include for comparison and contrast a selection of works by his contemporaries\u2014including painters, printmakers, and poster artists\u2014to evoke the life and art of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Montmartre. This supporting cast includes such famous names as Degas, Van Gogh, and Picasso, but also less well-known artists such as Anquetin, Steinlen, and Casas, who also captured the spirit of the age. The inclusion of these works adds a new dimension to our understanding of Toulouse-Lautrec and his time.\n\n\nCATALOGUE\nThe exhibition catalogue, Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre, is available in the Museum Shop. Hardcover, $60; softcover, $40. Click here for more information.\n\n\nORGANIZERS\nThis exhibition was organized by the Art Institute of Chicago and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\n\nCURATORS\nGuest curator for Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre is professor Richard Thomson, University of Edinburgh, a leading scholar of Toulouse-Lautrec and fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris and curator of the 1991\u201392 retrospective.

In Chicago, organizing curators are Douglas Druick, Searle Curator of European Painting and Prince Trust Curator of Prints and Drawings, and Gloria Groom, David and Mary Winton Green Curator of Medieval through Modern European Painting and Modern European Sculpture, and Mary Weaver Chapin, former Mellon Curatorial Fellow.\n\n\nOTHER VENUES\nToulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre was presented at the National Gallery of Art from March 20 to June 12, 2005, and is on view at the Art Institute of Chicago from July 16 to October 10, 2005.\n\n\nSPONSORS\nThe Sara Lee Foundation is the exclusive corporate sponsor of Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre.",
