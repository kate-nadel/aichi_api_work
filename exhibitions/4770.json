    "description": "This exhibit showed only the work of Parisian sculptors Claude and Francois-Xavier Lalannes. This exhibit came about as the result of a previous exhibition they had in Paris during 1966, in which they gained great notoriety. Both Lalannes work through expression and form in their work, which blends sculpture with home decor. Francois-Xavier Lalanne\u2019s work was larger in size and were made with many different types of metals. In contrast, Claude Lalanne\u2019s work is relatively small and reminiscent of precious objects. Her attention to detail called attention to her exquisite workmanship. Claude Lalanne often used material such as leaves, lobster claws, and twigs. This exhibit was lyrical in presentation, with the two artist\u2019s work in perfect juxtaposition to the other.",
