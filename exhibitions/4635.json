    "description": "This Beckmann retrospective commemorated the artist\u2019s 80th birthday. Over 200 paintings, drawings and prints were displayed, all of which served to trace the artist\u2019s career from Germany to Holland to the United States. The spanse of his work is covered, from the early works which earned him the title of \u201cGerman Delacroix,\u201d to his masterpieces of the New Realism movement in the 1920\u2019s, to the deeply symbolic work of his last years, where his obsessions with space, color, and private symbolism became the artist\u2019s main focus. According to the curator of the exhibit, Peter Selz, Beckmann\u2019s mysterious work defies any literal interpretation.",
