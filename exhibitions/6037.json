    "description": "This was the first retrospective exhibit of 20th Century painting in France in many years. Over 100 paintings were shown and many of them focused on Parisian artists as well as artists who worked primarily in Paris. The exhibit began with a collection of paintings from 1900-1930, and featured the work of artists such as Bonnard, Rouault, Matisse, Leger, Gris, Miro, Picasso, Delaugnay and others. The next part of the exhibition correlated with the development of the Paris School in the 1940s-1950s, in which artists like Giacometti, Balthus, and de Stael thrived. Finally, the exhibit concluded with a contemporary section, featuring artists like Soto, Appel, Dubuffet, and Vasarely. Overall, the exhibition illustrated the development of Post-Impressionism through Cubism and then into French contemporary geometric art.",
