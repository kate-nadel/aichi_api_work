    "description": "The art exhibition at the American pavilion was selected and organized by Katharine Kuh, Curator of Modern Painting and Sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago. Rather than selecting a representation of contemporary American artists, Kuh decided upon a thematic exhibition of how artists see or are inspired by the American cities. Artists such as Edward Hopper, Mark Tobey, Jackson Pollack, Willem DeKooning and Ben Shahn participated.",
