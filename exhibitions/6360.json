    "description": "During July 1940, a page from a rare block book of the Apocalypse of St. John was featured as Masterpiece of the Month. As described by the newsletter announcing its exhibition, \u201cthese books were printed from wood blocks on which the pictures [and] text were cut. The color was added later either by stencil as in this case, or by hand.\u201d These block books were inexpensive at the time and used mainly pictures to tell the story so its, often religious, messages could be accessible to the masses.",
