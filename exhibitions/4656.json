    "description": "This Alberto Giacometti exhibit was mounted in honor of the artist, who was considered one of the greatest living sculptors at the time. Nearly one-hundred-fifty works were shown, most of them evoking Giacometti\u2019s signature style: skeletal figures whose bodies flatten and stretch in bizarre ways. The artist\u2019s strangely elusive sculptures often evoked visceral and philosophical reactions alike, leaving audiences of this exhibit to interpret the works as \u201ceroded icons, human candles guttering in their own flesh,\u201d as one viewer said. The exhibit offered an extensive collection of Giacometti\u2019s paintings, drawings, and sculptures and showed the artist\u2019s progression from impressionistic paintings, to cubist sculptures, and eventually to his surrealist sculptures for which he is best known.",
