    "description": "This traveling exhibition of 65 bronze statuettes was selected from the collection of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum to provide a historical cross-section representing a centuries-long European collecting tradition. The works chosen for exhibition all had variants or counterparts in American museum collections. The exhibition opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art following its run at the Art Institute of Chicago. To supplement the show while it was in Chicago, Art Institute curator Ian Wardropper selected 80 examples of Renaissance decorative arts from Chicago collections to display, including a clock and reliquary that showcased some of the same techniques and ornament used in the bronze statuettes.",
