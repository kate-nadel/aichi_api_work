    "description": "This exhibit was coordinated and curated by a committee within the Japan Art Festival Association. It was the first festival of its kind, and was one of the largest collections of contemporary Japanese art ever assembled. Over eighty contemporary artists had works in the show. Among the many pieces shown were paintings, prints, sculpture, ceramics, carved lacquerware, metalwork, woodwork, bamboo ware, textiles, and dyed fabrics. The exhibition operated as a cross-current between American and Japanese contemporary art, which most audiences were generally unfamiliar with at the time. Whereas the antiquities of Japan had long been acknowledged and collected in the Western World, Americans knew very little about contemporary Japanese art prior to this exhibit.",
