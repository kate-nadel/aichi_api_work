    "description": "This retrospective was one of the greatest Matisse exhibits ever assembled. The artist\u2019s full range of artistry, beginning with his early works in the first few years of the twentieth century all the way up to his most recently accomplished works were featured in the exhibit. Matisse\u2019s rival, his dear friend Pablo Picasso, lent his favorite painting, Oranges (1912) to the exhibition, making it the first time the painting has travelled to America. The deceased artist\u2019s children lent an incredible amount of art and information to the exhibit, ensuring that their father\u2019s legacy will be honored properly. Because the exhibit was so unusually important, the Art Institute remained open late on Tuesday and Thursday evenings to accommodate the large crowds.",
