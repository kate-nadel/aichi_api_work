    "description": "Nationally renowned for their acclaimed collection of contemporary art, Donna and Howard Stone are equally respected for their longstanding commitment to the city of Chicago and its arts community. The Stones view their passion for art and collecting as an important and treasured aspect of their partnership, and surely many Chicago institutions\u2014museums and universities especially\u2014have benefited greatly from their dedicated patronage. The Art Institute is thrilled to present the first public exhibition of works from their collection, featuring a number of important gifts to the museum, on view this summer in the Abbott Galleries and the eponymous Stone Film, Video, and New Media Gallery.\n\nPutting together their collection over the past three decades, the Stones have built a rich, intergenerational assortment of art in all media. While there is a focus on the Minimalist and Conceptual schools of the 1960s and 1970s, including works by artists such as Sol LeWitt, Dan Flavin, Fred Sandback, and Richard Tuttle, there are also substantial works by younger artists, such as Gabriel Orozco, Roni Horn, Robert Gober, and Felix Gonzalez-Torres, deeply influenced by that previous generation. With consideration given to works produced in Chicago and beyond, the collection has grown into a truly international representation of contemporary art-making practices of the last 50 years.",
