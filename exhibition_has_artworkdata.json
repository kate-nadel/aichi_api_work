  "description": "To herald the opening of the Modern Wing, the Department of Prints and Drawings will celebrate its extensive holdings of works on paper with an exhibition highlighting its modern and contemporary collection of drawings. Presenting approximately 80 works that, due to their inherent sensitivity to light, are rarely exhibited in public galleries, the exhibition shows artists\u2019 evolving use of drawing, from highly finished works of art to notational and diagrammatic sheets.\nThe exhibition begins with a display of the department\u2019s rich early modern collection. Highlights include works by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, as well as German School artists such as Max Beckmann and Ernst Kirchner. A selection of Dada and Surrealist drawings will be shown alongside ephemera and artists\u2019 books from the Ryerson Library\u2019s prized Mary Reynolds Collection. Next, works of postwar artists including Willem de Kooning and Lee Krasner demonstrate how American painters expanded the vocabularies of their European precursors. The exhibition concludes with the work of artists who matured after 1960. Iconic drawings by Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein will be joined by selections from the museum\u2019s broad holdings of works on paper by Felix Gonzalez-Torres and Martin Kippenberger.\nAdditionally, the exhibition presents many pieces new to the collection. Recently acquired drawings by Minimalists such as Robert Mangold, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Robert Ryman, and Richard Tuttle make their debut, as do works such as Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s Alka Seltzer, a stunning image that the artist never repeated in another medium. Also highlighted are freshly conserved works, including an exquisite example of a Purist drawing by Le Corbusier that shows the architect at his best as an artist.\nDisplaying major works by many of the artists that will be featured in the permanent galleries of the Modern Wing, this exhibition showcases the Art Institute\u2019s long-held commitment to collecting and exhibiting the art of our time.",

  "description": "A longstanding anchor of the curriculum, printmaking at the School of the Art Institute (SAIC) has been greatly enriched by the museum\u2019s collection and exhibitions, which have fostered the collaboration of print media with painting, photography, and other studio endeavors. This exhibition takes a look at an explosive period in Chicago printmaking when GIs returning from World War II swelled the SAIC\u2019s enrollment and increased demand to work with print media. Featured are works by artists who studied at SAIC and/or made Chicago their home base.\nAn SAIC alumnus, Vera Berdich was introduced to printmaking through the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. In 1947, Berdich became the etching instructor at SAIC and substantially expanded both the facilities and program in intaglio (etching and its related processes including mezzotint and drypoint). For over 30 years, she worked in intaglio and explored other techniques, especially non-silver photographic techniques such as clich\u00e9 verre and gum bichromate printing. One gallery of the exhibition is devoted to a progression of her rich intaglio plate, Pool of Tears, with state, trial, and color proofs shown together.\nThe work of Berdich\u2019s student and assistant, Philip Hanson, a noted painter and current professor at SAIC, will also be on view. During his period with Berdich, Hanson developed a sophisticated body of etchings, some recently acquired by the Art Institute. Produced concurrently with paintings on similar themes, these etchings reflect an array of Hanson\u2019s interests from Chicago icons and Baroque stagecraft to comic books and lessons learned from his scrutiny of Picasso\u2019s planar development of forms in space.\nAlso on display will be prints by H. C. (Cliff) Westermann, one of the foremost artists to study at SAIC after World War II and well-known for the economy of line\u2014nuanced yet brash\u2014in both his drawings and lithographs. Highlighted is Westermann\u2019s portfolio See America First, which captured the spirit of mid-century America\u2019s culture and landscape as he and his wife Joanna Beall traveled between the coasts in a restored pick-up truck that also served as their home. His distinctive body of work continues to influence young artists and enthusiasts who encounter it for the first time.\nTogether these complex works showcase the historical vitality of SAIC and the city as a crucial breeding ground for printmaking innovation.",

  "title": "Dionysos Unmasked: Ancient Sculpture and Early Prints",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "This innovative collaboration between the Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art and the Department of Prints and Drawings examines Renaissance and Baroque printmakers\u2019 direct responses to Classical antiquity through the figure of Dionysos, the ancient Greek god of wine and theater. Installed in the Mary and Michael Jaharis Galleries of Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Art, this exhibition juxtaposes ancient sculpture with prints from the 15th through the 18th century with nearly 100 objects\u2014pieces from the permanent collection, new loans of ancient art, and recently acquired works on paper.\n\nDionysos\u2014known as Bacchus to the Romans\u2014cavorted with an entourage of satyrs, the god Pan, and frenzied maenads, female followers of the god. All these devotees represented the untamed and hedonistic desires of humanity, which were unleashed by the intoxicating elixir of wine. Because performance was a part of the early Greek festivals of Dionysos, he also became known as the patron god of theater, an aspect of the deity that is less well known today. In ancient art, Dionysos could take many forms, from a graceful youth to a bearded mature man. During the Renaissance and Baroque periods, the time of early printmaking, interest in antiquity\u2014especially Dionysos\u2014flourished. Ancient sculptures depicting the god and his raucous retinue inspired artists to find new ways to transform age-old Dionysian subjects into prints and drawings that would appeal to their own contemporary audiences.\n\nAnchoring the exhibition are Greek and Roman sculptures depicting Dionysos and his wild followers along with vessels used in ritual drinking parties and festivals honoring the god of wine and theater. Their printed counterparts are masterpieces from the Italian Renaissance to the French Rococo, including notably Andrea Mantegna\u2019s Bacchanal with a Wine Vat, a 15th-century Italian engraving with striking visual similarity to the bronze Statue of Young Dionysos (a current long-term loan to the museum). Bringing together this rich selection of works, separated by as many as 1,500 years, this exhibition offers new, enticing insights into the art of Classical antiquity and its later revivals.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "To celebrate the long-awaited release of American Modernism at the Art Institute of Chicago: From World War I to 1955, a scholarly catalogue showcasing the Art Institute\u2019s expansive permanent collection of American art, the Department of Prints and Drawings has organized this companion exhibition. Approximately 140 prints, drawings, collages, and watercolors from the permanent collection offer the opportunity to ruminate on what constituted \u201cmodern\u201d at various moments during the first half of the 20th century.\nRanging from Edward Hopper\u2019s watercolors of streetwalkers, painted in 1906, to Willem de Kooning\u2019s black enamel drip drawing of 1950, Modern in America showcases the wide variety of media and subject matter explored by American artists as they sought to respond to the compelling issues of their generations. Iconic images such as George Wesley Bellows\u2019s lithograph A Stag at Sharkey\u2019s and Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s rich pastel White Shell with Red\u2014true touchstones of American art\u2014stand in contrast to 30 rarely seen working drawings by Peter Blume for his famous painting The Rock, also in the Art Institute\u2019s collection.\nWorking on paper often provided artists with an affordable and direct way of responding to and mirroring their experiences. Starkly powerful lithographs of the 1930s, together with Jacob Lawrence\u2019s dynamic gouache paintings, demonstrate how works on paper could be both topical and intensely personal. Images of the modern city by Stuart Davis, Reginald Marsh, and Charles Sheeler offer public and private perspectives on the urban experience, while landscapes of rural America by Grant Wood and Walter Ellison suggest the tension between modern stylistic concerns and traditional subject matter.\nPrints and drawings also reveal how American artists responded to their encounters with European Modernism. The wave of interest in formal abstraction in the wake of the Armory Show of 1913 was followed by the distillation of natural forms by artists such as Rockwell Kent, Arthur Dove, O\u2019Keeffe, and Marsden Hartley. Modern in America also considers the influential contributions of European-born American artists such as Arshile Gorky, Yves Tanguy, and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy and of Mexican artists who worked extensively in the United States, including Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros.",

  "title": "Abstract Experiments: Latin American Art on Paper after 1950",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "During the mid-20th century, Latin American artists were active in the evolving international discourse on modernity, expanding upon these debates in light of localized conditions and concerns. Their work resulted in original and hybrid aesthetic strategies, responding to the industrial expansion that colored the social and economic conditions in South America following World War II and to the political transformations of the time. This exhibition, drawn primarily from the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection, explores this pivotal period in the development of abstraction in South America.\nEstablished in 1944, the Buenos Aires\u2013based Asociaci\u00f3n Arte Concreto-Invenci\u00f3n favored pure geometric abstraction, inspired by early 20th-century European artists. Prints by founding members Alfredo Hlito and Manuel Espinosa represent the aesthetic goals of the group, a style of Argentine constructivism animated by utopian idealism and Marxist politics. Prints by Carlos Cruz-Diez and Manuel Espinoza illustrate what came to be known as Venezuelan kineticism; Cruz-Diez and his contemporaries were searching for an egalitarian form of art based in perceptual manipulation through additive color experiments. In Brazil, the Neo-Concreto movement\u2014as exemplified by Lygia Clark and Lygia Pape, associates of H\u00e9lio Oiticica\u2014advocated a version of concretism that embraced color, sensuality, and poetry while challenging the very idea of the object itself.\nThe exhibition also includes the work of two European-born Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s, Gertrud Goldschmidt, professionally known as Gego, and Mira Schendel, who were based in Venezuela and Brazil, respectively, as well as the work of Leon Ferrari, an Argentine who lived in exile in Brazil from 1976 to 1991. All three explored the expressive possibilities of line, but their work shares more aesthetically than conceptually. Ferrari was decidedly the most political, while Gego was more concerned with form and volume; Schendel\u2019s work explores the relationship of language and art and suggests the shortcomings of the spoken and written word.\nProviding an illuminating complement to H\u00e9lio Oiticica: To Organize Delirium, this exhibition also reflects recent efforts by the Art Institute to expand its holdings of Latin American painting, sculpture, and works on paper.",

  "title": "Burnishing the Night:  Baroque to Contemporary Mezzotints from the Collection / Eldzier Cortor Coming Home: Recent Gifts to the AIC",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Excelling in eerie effects and seductive textures, the late 17th-century medium of mezzotint blossomed from an amateur fascination and hobby of members of the nobility to the 18th century\u2019s most popular reproductive printmaking method. Mezzotint engraving allowed artists to burnish soft highlights and volume into a textured copper plate that would otherwise print in a solid tone. This shading method contrasted dramatically with the standard intaglio medium, which involved either painstakingly incising engraved lines with a burin (a metal-cutting tool) or etching looser lines into a plate with acid. Ideal for nocturnal scenes, portraits, reproductions of paintings, lush landscapes, and garish anatomical and botanical studies, the versatile medium later lent itself to color printing and remains in use today.\nBurnishing the Night brings together mezzotint prints, books with mezzotint illustrations, and other works on paper from the permanent collection that span the medium\u2019s predominantly Northern European origins through its worldwide use in the 20th century. Several works in the show are by Irish mezzotint engravers, especially Thomas Frye, whose imaginative head studies will also be featured in this spring\u2019s highly anticipated exhibition Ireland: Crossroads of Art and Design, 1690\u20131840. Frye\u2019s evocative Young Man with a Candle from 1760 demonstrates the liquid effects made possible by the mezzotint medium, from the bulging, startled eyes to the dancing candlelit shadows and dripping wax. The viewer waits with bated breath along with this startled youth, enjoying the theatrical uncertainty of a ghost story, printed in velvet tones.\nA complementary and concurrent installation in Gallery 208A, Printing Darkness and Light in the Dutch Republic, details how Rembrandt and other artists created their own dramatic \u201cDark Manner\u201d or \u201cNight Pieces\u201d without the use of mezzotint.",

  "title": "Alfred Stieglitz and the Nineteenth Century",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Alfred Stieglitz (American, 1864\u20131946) tirelessly promoted photography as a fine art. Through his own photographic work over the course of a half-century, the photographic journals he edited and published, and the New York galleries at which he organized exhibitions of photographs, paintings, and sculpture, Stieglitz showed photography to be an integral part of modern art in America. In a search for artistic ancestors, he looked intently at photography of the 19th century, most notably that of Julia Margaret Cameron and the Scottish duo David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson. Their work resonated for Pictorialism, a movement that valued painterly, handcrafted images, and these earlier photographs were exhibited and reprinted for new audiences. Stieglitz\u2019s fledgling interest to create a history of photography as an art form was also evidenced in his decision, later in his career, to revisit his own prior output, reprinting earlier images in a high modernist style.\n\nThe Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute includes several later Cameron and Hill and Adamson prints along with important works by Stieglitz himself, Edward Steichen, and other Pictorialist artists. Drawn entirely from the permanent collection, this exhibition examines how 19th-century photographs influenced Pictorialist practice. Fostering close looking at different photographic processes\u2014from salt and albumen prints of the 19th century, to carbon prints and photogravures of turn-of-the-century reproduction, to crisp gelatin silver prints of the modernist period\u2014it shows Stieglitz and his circle in the context of a changing photographic history.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Clothing\u2019s ability to express and convey information such as age, class, marital status, or social condition is not limited to a single culture or locale but is truly universal. Japanese kimonos are no exception with features such as sleeve length or decoration offering the viewer information about the wearer. This exhibition explores the role that traditional motifs, techniques, and modernization played in the development of pattern design in women\u2019s kimono and haori, a short kimono-like jacket, during the Taish\u00f4 period (1912\u20131926) and the early Sh\u00f4wa period (1926\u20131989).\n\nThe designs of kimono for formal and ceremonial events often adhered to conventional patterns with carefully planned designs suited to specific occasions. They were expensive undertakings, often custom-made and purchased from merchants who specialized in kimonos. With noticeably shorter sleeves, informal kimono and haori for everyday use were less opulent than their formal counterparts. The design of this more casual wear borrowed from the large repertoire of traditional motifs but also included abstracted forms and designs inspired by Western art movements.\n\nIn the 1910s, informal kimonos took a new turn with ready-to-wear designs appearing in department stores, where a quality garment could be bought at an affordable price, and by the mid-1920s, these broadly available styles were changing seasonally akin to Western fashion. Often referred to as taish\u00f4 modo (referring to Taish\u00f4 fashionable kimono) or taish\u00f4 roman (Taish\u00f4 romantic style), these desirable and fashionable garments maintained a conventional form while displaying bold and brightly colored designs and ornamentation. They appealed to the urban modern girl who embraced popular culture and changing fashions.\n\nAlthough the basic construction and form of the kimono has altered little over the course of six centuries, the evolving patterning and decoration make the kimono an exquisite and dynamic garment. By showcasing the kimono\u2019s influences and developments from formal traditions to graphically vibrant off-the-rack designs, this exhibition illustrates how the Japanese have embraced modernism while still retaining their cultural history.",

  "description": "The Kabuki theater was one of the main preoccupations of the \u201cfloating world\u201d of 18th-century Edo (modern day Tokyo). While fans idolized actors, the Katsukawa School of artists, active from the mid-1760s to the mid-1790s, created hundreds of pictures of famous performers. In two successive exhibitions, the Art Institute displays some of the more than 700 Katsukawa School prints in the museum\u2019s collection and explores the Kabuki dramas presented.",

  "title": "Into the Void: Prints of Lee Bontecou",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The images of Lee Bontecou (American, born 1931) are unmistakably hers: black voids, cosmic orbs, floating serrated teeth, mutant flowers, and strange, hybrid forms. They reflect a post\u2013World War II angst and existential fear brought on by the arms race and nuclear threat, coupled with awe at a technology capable of space travel. While best known for her wall reliefs that bridge the divide between painting and sculpture, Bontecou produced a series of important prints between 1962 and 1982 at Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), a workshop founded by Tatyana Grosman in West Islip, New York, in 1957. This exhibition is the first show devoted to Bontecou\u2019s prints since 1975 and is drawn from the Art Institute\u2019s complete edition and significant archive of her ULAE production.\n\nIn Bontecou\u2019s prints, as in her early sculptures, the color black dominates. \u201cGetting the black,\u201d she said, \u201copened everything up.\u201d The color, through its endless interpretability, evokes the mystery of the infinite and the terror of the unknown. Her powerful prints\u2014mostly lithographs but some etchings\u2014attend to all of the profound issues Bontecou addressed in her sculptures and drawings. In particular, many of the prints she produced at ULAE explore the black void at the heart of her early sculptures, a motif that runs through her entire career.\n\nInto the Void: Prints of Lee Bontecou analyzes for the first time the totality of her prints as a reflection and an extension of her larger corpus, showing not only final states of her prints but also working proofs, variant states, finished and preparatory drawings, matrices (such as the copper etching plates used to print her works), and other ephemera that shed further light on her practice. Including over 100 objects, the exhibition explores the phenomena of process, repetition, and artistic obsession, and traces Bontecou\u2019s voyage through a series of experiments and happy accidents toward the mystique of her final, definitive images.",

  "title": "Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and the Portrait Print",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In the last decade of his life, acclaimed painter Anthony van Dyck (1599\u20131641) began a printmaking project that would change the conventions of portraiture: the Iconography. This art history\u2013changing series of over 100 portrait prints radically depicted artists on par with the most significant monarchs, diplomats, and scholars of the day. Presenting several etchings from the Iconography\u2014on view for the first time in nearly 90 years\u2014together with works by various artists from the 16th through the 20th century, this exhibition examines Van Dyck\u2019s lasting influence on the evolution of the portrait print and its significance as a distinct genre.\nThough already celebrated internationally for his work as a painter, Van Dyck contributed directly to the Iconography series, producing 15 etchings with his own hands. In many other cases, printmaking specialists and collaborators such as Lucas Vorsterman (1595\u20131675) and Paulus Pontius (1603\u201358) realized prints for the series based on Van Dyck\u2019s drawn or painted designs. The Art Institute of Chicago is fortunate to own all of the etchings that Van Dyck made along with several prints from the series designed by the artist and produced by his hired printmakers. Despite the significance of these etchings to Van Dyck\u2019s career and their importance to the history of portraiture\u2014and indeed to the history of printmaking\u2014these works have not been exhibited publicly at the Art Institute since they first entered the collection in 1929, and their impact on the broader field of the portrait print has not yet been fully examined.\nComprising approximately 140 works, including selected subjects from Van Dyck\u2019s Iconography, this exhibition features prints from five centuries. The earliest works, by artists such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471\u20131528) and Hendrick Goltzius (1558\u20131617), precede Van Dyck\u2019s career, while portraits by Rembrandt van Rijn (1606\u201369) and Jan Lievens (1607\u201374), artists who followed Van Dyck, demonstrate his immediate influence. Continuing to follow Van Dyck\u2019s impact on the genre are works by artists such as Francisco de Goya (1746\u20131828), Edgar Degas (1834\u20131917), K\u00e4the Kollwitz (1867\u20131945), and Chuck Close (born 1940). Adding to the presentation is a gallery that explores the political role of the portrait print as well as one devoted to portraits created in various media during the 17th century\u2014drawings, painted miniatures, wax and marble sculptures, and paintings of an intimate scale\u2014all highlighting the unique qualities of the portrait print.\nA full-color publication of approximately 112 pages accompanies this exhibition.\n \nSupport for Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and the Portrait Print is generously provided by Alan Templeton and Prince Charitable Trusts.",

  "title": "Ethel Stein, Master Weaver",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Ethel Stein is an artist who only now, at the age of 96, is beginning to get the recognition she deserves from the broader public. She has never been overly concerned with promoting or marketing her work, and she has tended to lean \u201ccounter-trend,\u201d as textile designer Jack Lenor Larsen has aptly put it, creating squares of quiet pattern to be placed on walls at a time when other textile artists were emphasizing the sculptural potential of fiber by working in three dimensions. Produced on a drawloom\u2014a type of handloom that incorporates a figure harness capable of controlling each warp thread separately\u2014her work seems deceptively simple, but as one understands the mysteries and complexities of this weaving method historically favored for creating figured textiles, the sophistication and challenge of her work become undeniable.\n\nStein\u2019s great contribution to weaving is her unique combination of refined traditional weaving techniques, possible only on a drawloom and used by few contemporary weavers, with modernist sensibilities influenced by Josef Albers, who trained in the German Bauhaus with its emphasis on simplicity, order, functionality, and modesty. Over the years she has favored three particular structures with strong historical traditions\u2014damask, double-cloth, and lampas\u2014and it is due to the flexibility of the drawloom that her work appears so refreshingly uncomplicated.\n\nThis exhibition, presented in the newly reopened textiles galleries comprised of the Agnes Allerton Gallery and the Elizabeth F. Cheney Gallery, presents drawloom weavings executed by the artist from 1982 through 2008. All works are either already in the collection of the Art Institute or have been promised as gifts. The retrospective installation celebrates in particular Ethel Stein\u2019s generous donation of 34 of her own works two years ago, as well as Leanne Lachman\u2019s promised gift of four additional pieces, which help fill out the picture of Stein\u2019s impressive career. These 38 weavings join a work in five parts, woven in 1982, that came into the collection in 1985, courtesy of the Nicole Williams Contemporary Textile Fund.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The focus series exhibition In All My Wildest Dreams is the first American museum show devoted to the work of Kemang Wa Lehulere (born Cape Town, 1984). Internationally recognized for his masterful conflation of personal and collective storytelling, Wa Lehulere reenacts what he calls \u201cdeleted scenes\u201d from South African history, often animating individual narratives of exile or displacement through means that are ephemeral, found, and notational\u2014chalk drawings on blackboard surfaces, intense but short-lived performances, salvaged wood from old school desks, sketchbook pages, letters written to friends, strangers, and public institutions\u2014as if to suggest the gallery as a fantastical, crucially temporary classroom. \u201cHistory continually disappears,\u201d Wa Lehulere has said. \u201cIt comes and goes. It is not something fixed; it is malleable. . . . It is the elasticity of history that excites me.\u201d At the same time, he describes his work as a \u201cprotest against forgetting\u201d; history is constructed, and memory is fragile.\n\nBeginning with the title of his Art Institute exhibition, Wa Lehulere invokes not only the past and an imagined future but also a present in which dreams might materialize. New sculptures, paintings, video, and a wall carving demonstrate the artist\u2019s evocative visual language through certain recurrent motifs\u2014imagery of rehearsing, revising,  and recovering, for instance, or signifiers of travel, transit, and mobility, such as used suitcases, tires, wooden crutches, and a trio of suspended \u201cpaper planes.\u201d More than 20 ceramic dogs suggest tchotchkes and, more solemnly, household guardian figures. Dozens of small drawings reveal the artist\u2019s working process.\n\nAt the heart of this show is a vigorous performance work, Echoes of Our Footsteps (A Reenactment of a Rehearsal). Video of the piece, as performed by Wa Lehulere and Chuma Sopotela, is shown on a loop in front of a demarcated but empty performance space that appears to be waiting for its actors. Any artwork could be understood as the record of an artist\u2019s thought and activity, but for Wa Lehulere, questions of residue and memory, of physical presence and palpable absence, are instrumental\u2014at once aesthetic and ethical\u2014rather than merely incidental. \n\nThe focus exhibition Kemang Wa Lehulere: In All My Wildest Dreams is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago.",

  "title": "What May Come: The Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular and the Mexican Political Print",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The most influential and enduring progressive printmaking collective of its time, the Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular (the Popular Graphic Art Workshop or TGP) created some of the most memorable images in mid-century printmaking. This Mexico City\u2013based workshop took up the legacy of the famous Mexican broadside illustrator Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada, creating prints, posters, and illustrated publications that were popular, affordable, legible, politically topical, and, above all, formally compelling. This exhibition includes over 100 works from the Art Institute\u2019s rich holdings\u2014one of the most significant TGP collections in the United States\u2014demonstrating why this collective boasted such international influence and inspired the establishment of print collectives around the world.\nFounded in 1937 by Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez, Luis Arenal, and American-born Pablo O\u2019Higgins, the TGP emerged and evolved in the crucible of antifascist and leftist politics in Mexico in the period surrounding World War II. This milieu shaped not only the workshop\u2019s dedication to a collective printmaking model but also its production aimed at both \u201cthe people\u201d and discerning collectors, a strategy necessitated by the era\u2019s quickly changing political tides. The collective created works for groups spanning the leftist and progressive political spectrum, including the government of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and his successors, the Mexican Communist Party, major trade unions, and antifascist organizations.\nDuring the TGP\u2019s heyday, from its founding until the 1950s, the workshop produced thousands of prints, primarily linocuts and lithographs, for everything from ephemeral handbills and newspapers to political and advertising posters to luxe portfolios and printed books. Favoring an expressive, realist visual language, its work addressed a wide range of socially engaged themes, including Mexican history and culture, political satires both local and international (including calavera broadsides), rural and urban scenes of daily life, and agitprop prints. The members of the workshop, a core of about 40 during its height, produced both individual and collective works and welcomed numbers of foreign members and guest artists\u2014from Elizabeth Catlett to Josef Albers\u2014to use the workshop in order to collaborate on prints and create individual pieces.\nShowcasing the TGP\u2019s prolific and varied output, What May Come is organized into thematic sections such as Chicago connections to the TGP, antifascism, national history, daily life, caricature, and popular visual traditions. A Spanish-English catalogue accompanies the exhibition, which also features bilingual labeling.",

  "description": "\u201cFirst, and emphatically, I accept the flat plane of the picture surface as the primary frame of reference of the picture.\u201d\u2014Aaron Siskind, \u201cCredo,\u201d 1950\n\nAlthough he started his career as a documentary photographer, Aaron Siskind (American, 1903\u20131991) quickly became known for his abstract photographs. Socially and professionally close with many of the Abstract Expressionist painters in his native New York, Siskind created photographs in dialogue with painting, attempting to find a new language for photographic depiction that could transform an object into an image, a description into an idea. Across a decades-long career, his work explored what he called \u201cthe drama of objects,\u201d imbuing forms with animism and rhythm. \n\nSiskind spent two formative decades in Chicago, from 1951 to 1971, teaching at the city\u2019s famed Institute of Design and mentoring generations of photographers. His relationship with the Art Institute of Chicago stretches back to 1955, when he was given a one-person show; the museum began consistently collecting his work the following year. \n\nThis exhibition, featuring 100 photographs drawn exclusively from the Art Institute\u2019s extensive holdings of Siskind\u2019s work, examines some of his most influential abstract photographs and series. Beginning with Siskind\u2019s new attention to the power of a single object in the 1940s, the presentation continues through formally graphic series such as barely touching rocks in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, seaweed shapes on sand, and divers silhouetted against the sky at Oak Street Beach. The show culminates in increasingly flat and abstract images of walls with peeling and dripping paint, including a series in homage to the painter Franz Kline. Twenty-five years after Siskind\u2019s death, this exhibition demonstrates his ongoing relevance for a new generation of photographers embracing abstraction.",

  "description": "In Nothing Personal, works by three American artists come together in a show about the passage from personhood to persona.\n\nThe 82 photographs that make up The Fae Richards Archive provide a convincing record of a person who never existed. Fae Richards could have been an actress and singer who worked from the 1920s to the 1970s. She was black, gay, and talented, and she achieved success to the degree that circumstances permitted. Zoe Leonard meticulously prepared a mix of publicity shots, film stills, and personal photos to create this fictional archive. She researched historically appropriate photographic papers, and \u201ccast\u201d different printers as well, to guard against a uniform look. The results show happiness tinged with melancholy and ask us to think about what it means to go through life behaving as a credible facsimile.\n\nThe 70 black-and-white photographs in Cindy Sherman\u2019s series Untitled Film Stills constitute a major contribution to contemporary art. At 8 \u00d7 10 inches, Sherman\u2019s prints look like ordinary film stills: publicity images that stage scenes from a movie for press and other promotional uses. In fact, Sherman did not re-create any specific character or movie. Her one-person show, modeled mainly on European art-house cinema, features a range of postwar genres and female roles that the artist inhabits like a shadow. \u201cThe characters weren\u2019t just airhead actresses,\u201d Sherman has said. \u201cThe clothes make them seem a certain way, but then you look at their expression and wonder if maybe \u2018they\u2019 are not what the clothes are communicating.\u201d\n\nLorna Simpson\u2019s fifth video work, Corridor, compares two historical periods: the mid-19th and the mid-20th centuries. Two characters, each alone in her domestic world, bring these moments to life, moving in parallel or in tandem through their respective daily routines. One appears to be a household servant or freed slave from around 1860, the other a successful homeowner living one century later\u2014yet both are played by a single person, the artist Wangechi Mutu. The soundtrack, composed by John Davis, similarly contrasts a variety of musical sources, including echoes of \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic,\u201d Chopinesque piano, New Orleans dirges, and free jazz. Using sounds instead of words, the two characters\u2014who are and are not the same woman\u2014carry on a dialogue across the divide of time and circumstance.\n\nSponsors\n\nGenerous in-kind support for this exhibition is provided by Tru Vue, Inc. and Gemini Moulding, Inc.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre\nJuly 16\u2013October 10, 2005\nRegenstein Hall\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864\u20131901), one of the most popular and important painters of late-19th-century Paris, has not been the subject of a major exhibition since the large retrospective presented in London and Paris in 1991 and 1992. The National Gallery of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago have collaborated to organize Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre, an exhibition that places the artist's work at the peak of his career between 1888 and 1896 in conjunction with the work of other artists of the period. Toulouse-Lautrec and his contemporaries produced images that evocatively record the social geography of Montmartre, Paris' center of licit and illicit entertainment. Taking Montmartre as a state of mind as well as an environment, the exhibition reevaluates the decadent worldview of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris. The focus is on several Montmartre establishments, including dance halls, the circus, and maisons closes (a French euphemism for brothels), and the installation integrates major avant-garde paintings, topographical canvases, and posters and caricatures of stars such as Aristide Bruant and Lo\u00efe Fuller.\n\nThe aim of the exhibition is to place Toulouse-Lautrec in a wider cultural context and to include for comparison and contrast a selection of works by his contemporaries\u2014including painters, printmakers, and poster artists\u2014to evoke the life and art of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Montmartre. This supporting cast includes such famous names as Degas, Van Gogh, and Picasso, but also less well-known artists such as Anquetin, Steinlen, and Casas, who also captured the spirit of the age. The inclusion of these works adds a new dimension to our understanding of Toulouse-Lautrec and his time.\n\n\nCATALOGUE\nThe exhibition catalogue, Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre, is available in the Museum Shop. Hardcover, $60; softcover, $40. Click here for more information.\n\n\nORGANIZERS\nThis exhibition was organized by the Art Institute of Chicago and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\n\nCURATORS\nGuest curator for Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre is professor Richard Thomson, University of Edinburgh, a leading scholar of Toulouse-Lautrec and fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris and curator of the 1991\u201392 retrospective.

  "short_description": "Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864\u20131901), one of the most popular and important painters of late-19th-century Paris, has not been the subject of a major exhibition since the large retrospective presented in London and Paris in 1991 and 1992. The National Gallery of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago have collaborated to organize Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre, an exhibition that places the artist's work at the peak of his career between 1888 and 1896 in conjunction with the work of other artists of the period.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The 1909 Plan of Chicago played a major role in the global history of urban planning and remains one of the largest and most comprehensive proposals for the transformation of an American city. Authored by architects Daniel H. Burnham and Edward H. Bennett with a committee of advisors from the Commercial Club of Chicago, the plan addressed issues common to many urban centers of this era, including insufficient infrastructure, the need for accessible green space, troubled class relations, and the lack of a strong civic image and identity for the city of Chicago.\n\nThe visual language of the plan has played a large role in its enduring legacy, including, most notably, a series of monumental watercolors created by the American artist and illustrator Jules Gu\u00e9rin. From Gu\u00e9rin\u2019s sweeping bird\u2019s-eye views of the city center and lakefront to maps proposing a commanding new geometry for Chicago\u2019s urban fabric, the plan\u2019s images constitute a powerful pictorial narrative about the nature and goals of urban change. Ultimately, the Plan of Chicago communicated the authors\u2019 belief in the power of order and beauty to transform the everyday lives of Chicago residents, and by extension, all American citizens.",

  "title": "A Portrait of Antinous, In Two Parts",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "An exceptionally beautiful Greek youth, Antinous was a favorite of Roman Emperor Hadrian. Following the young man\u2019s mysterious death by drowning in the Nile River, Antinous was proclaimed a god, and portraits of him appeared across the Roman Empire.\n\nThis focused exhibition unites two marbles portraying Antinous\u2014which recent discoveries reveal were originally one. After years of careful study, an international collaboration among the Art Institute of Chicago, the Palazzo Altemps Museum in Rome, and the University of Chicago determined that the Art Institute\u2019s fragment of a portrait of Antinous was originally the face of the Altemps\u2019s bust. (That bust received a replacement face by the mid-18th century.)\n\nThe centerpiece of the exhibition is a reconstruction of the original statue combining the two parts, showing how the statue would have appeared in antiquity. Laser scanning and three-dimensional printing were used to produce a mold from which the plaster replica was created. This very 21st-century plaster cast, together with both ancient works\u2014the Art Institute\u2019s face and the Altemps\u2019s bust\u2014and additional information present new and intriguing stories about these sculptures and the fascinating subject they depict.\n\nSponsors\nSupport for this exhibition is provided by Fred Eychaner and the Jaharis Family Foundation, Inc.",

  "description": "During October 1940, an ecclesiastical embroidery from Spain was exhibited as Masterpiece of the Month. It was made with silk and gold thread during the third quarter of the 15th century. Commissioned by the order of Pedro de Montoya, Bishop of Osma (1454-1475), who gifted the altarpiece to the Cathedral of Burgo de Osma. According to the newsletter announcing its exhibition, the embroidery was \u201coriginally made in two sections, the upper, with its central representation of the Madonna and Child Enthroned, serving as a retable and the lower serving as an altar frontal, or antependium\u201d. The part of the inscription still intact reads: \u201cO Homo Recordare Quia Pro Te IHS Hic Tormtenta Passus Est\u201d (Remember, O Man, that Christ suffered these pains for thee).",

  "description": "Planned to coincide with the Art Institute\u2019s major exhibition Picasso and Chicago this presentation from the Department of Prints and Drawings is inspired by the modern master's love of poetry\u2014Picasso was close friends with poets, including Max Jacob, Guillaume Apollinaire, Andr\u00e9 Breton, and Paul \u00c9luard, and collaborated with them from his earliest days in Paris. Taking Picasso's passion as a jumping-off point, this collection of works on paper surveys the myriad ways visual artists have been inspired by or collaborated with poets in the 20th century.\nThe exhibition begins with a selection of sheets from Robert Motherwell\u2019s A la Pintura (1968\u201372) and David Hockney\u2019s The Blue Guitar (1976\u201377), prints series inspired respectively by the poetry of Rafael Alberti and Wallace Stevens\u2014who was himself inspired by Picasso. The presentation continues with an exploration of the various working relationships between the artist and poet. Sometimes they are one and the same, such as Chicago\u2019s own, Tony Fitzpatrick. Sometimes they work in tandem or tangentially to illustrate a text, as in the portfolios by Ken Price and Alex Katz. And sometimes artists independently co-opt the words of another; Lesley Dill, for instance, uses the words of Emily Dickinson in compositions such as A Word Made Flesh (1994).\n \nAlso on display are the publications of Tatyana Grosman and her workshop Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), where poets have long played an important role\u2014as employees, muses, and collaborators. An early portfolio Stones (1957\u201359) exemplifies a collaborative relationship between the poet Frank O\u2019Hara and artist Larry Rivers, while Skin with O\u2019Hara Poem (1963\u201365), a print by Jasper Johns demonstrates O\u2019Hara\u2019s deeper impact on the artists who worked at ULAE. The word play of Edwin Schlossberg reveals how printing and materials impacts how one interprets text, and finally the series Fifth Stone, Sixth Stone (1967\u201368) by Lee Bontecou shows how the visual arts can likewise inspire the poet, in this case Tony Towle.\nOther galleries are devoted to the poetic inspiration of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, represented by the prints of Henri Matisse and Ellsworth Kelly, as well as the impact of Guillaume Apollinaire on Louis Marcoussis. Russian poetic sources ranging across the century are also included, interpreted in the visual works of Nathalija Gontcharova, Kazimir Malevich, and Robert Rauschenberg.",

  "title": "Eldzier Cortor Coming Home: Recent Gifts to the Art Institute",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In 2012, the celebrated artist Eldzier Cortor made an extraordinary gift to the Art Institute: a painting, 30 prints, and several printing matrices. Presenting selected works from the gift\u2014many on display for the first time\u2014this exhibition celebrates this outstanding addition to the collection.\n\nA Chicago native, Eldzier Cortor entered the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1936 and came under the influence of instructor Kathleen Blackshear, who led students to explore the regional arts of Africa and other non-Western cultures at the Field Museum and Oriental Institute in Chicago. At the same time, Cortor, like his peers in the Harlem Renaissance, was inspired by philosopher Alain Locke\u2019s call for African American artists to reclaim their ancestral heritage as a means of strengthening and enriching their expression.\n\nThese two influences can be seen at play throughout his career, even from its earliest moments. Working with the Federal Arts Program from 1938 to 1943, Cortor focused on African American social life on Chicago\u2019s South Side. Later, living and painting among the Gullah people (formerly enslaved Africans) on the Sea Islands off South Carolina, he became fascinated by their deep cultural connection to their African roots. His experiences with the Gullah fostered his decision to depict Woman as the archetypal image of all people. Eventually, this focus evolved to combine Woman and Dance, as shown in so many of the prints in this exhibition.\n\nAlthough Cortor primarily worked with intaglio printmaking processes, he produced several woodblock prints in the mid-1950s with Japanese printmaker Jun\u2019ichiro Sekino, a leading member of the Sosaku Hanga, or Creative Prints, movement. Five works from this period are on display, demonstrating the highly original hybrid of Western and Japanese techniques that resulted from Cortor and Sekino\u2019s close collaboration.\n\nAlso on view are some of Cortor\u2019s experimental prints made in Manhattan at Robert Blackburn\u2019s Printmaking Workshop, where he worked between 1955 and 1998. Some of these bear the title Abattoir, literally \u201cslaughterhouse.\u201d Although the artist was familiar with Chicago\u2019s notorious meatpacking industry, his works allude to the harsh environment he found in Haiti after several friends were killed by Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier\u2019s dictatorial regime.\n\nBringing together examples of Cortor\u2019s work throughout his remarkable career, this focused exhibition celebrates not only the artist\u2019s tireless innovation but also his tremendous generosity in sharing his work with the museum and our visitors. Thus the Art Institute is pleased to announce that Cortor, who turns 99 this January, will be this year\u2019s recipient of the Leadership Advisory Committee\u2019s Legends and Legacy Award, an honor recognizing African American artists who have achieved national acclaim with careers spanning over 50 years.",

It was Utamaro who gave us close-up portraits of beauties with pensive expressions, scenes of women engaged in everyday activities such as cooking, and images of women of every age against backgrounds that range from gray to yellow to brilliant (and luminescent) mica of various shades. Examples of each of these types of prints as well as illustrated books are on view.",

  "title": "Rarely Seen Contemporary Works on Paper",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Whether centuries old or the latest contemporary creations, works on paper are extremely light sensitive and can only be displayed in the galleries for short and infrequent periods of time before they must be returned to the safety of the dark, climate-controlled vault. Some of these works, however, also make brief appearances in the Prints and Drawings Study Room, frequently requested by professors for their classes to view as exemplars of specific techniques. This exhibition brings together nearly 100 of these highly popular contemporary works on paper, many of which have not been seen in our galleries in years (or ever), offering visitors an intriguing look at how this rich collection is used pedagogically.\nWhile tools and artistic methods are often privileged over historical significance or connoisseurship in these educational sessions, the exhibition offers abundant examples by artists whose works on paper were celebrated in their time and continue to influence subsequent generations. Harlem Renaissance artist Romare Bearden\u2019s iconic collage, The Return of Odysseus (Homage to Pintoricchio and Benin), makes a rare and welcome appearance, given that it is not often exhibited due to its fugitive materials\u2014cut and pasted papers, graphite, and touches of black and gray wash. Also included are multiple works by Carroll Dunham, Martin Kippenberger, and Ed Ruscha, some being exhibited for the first time in Chicago. In addition, curators from the Ryerson Library have selected post\u2013World War II comics publications by artists whose careers and aesthetic interests are related and sometimes influential to the other artists on view. Shown in this context are drawings informed by the conventions of graphic narratives, slapstick humor, and prescient social commentary.\nAlso on view are drawings by Chicago-based artists such as Julia Fish, who has a particular affinity for working on paper. Over the years, she has created drawings that not only extend her painting ideas but also exist as separate, self-contained bodies of work. Always focused on her immediate environment, Fish creates drawings based on memory and observations of the conditions surrounding her garden, as well as the properties of her house. She employs media specifically to evoke, rather than mimic, physicality, weight, touch, and time. Also a professor of art at the University of Illinois-Chicago, Fish is a frequent visitor to the Prints and Drawings Study Room herself and uses our diverse collection in part to teach students in the techniques demonstrated in this exhibition.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Robert Allerton was one of the great benefactors of the Art Institute of Chicago during the 20th century, both in terms of enlarging the building and expanding the collection. In 1968, four years after his death, the museum honored his legacy by naming the museum\u2019s original building on Michigan Avenue the Robert Allerton Building.\n\nAmong Allerton\u2019s gifts to the museum in the 1920s were 74 contemporary European textiles\u2014printed dress or furnishing fabrics or machine-made embroidered-lace curtain fabrics. All were the work of designers in Vienna, Dresden, Munich, and Paris, and all were acquired directly from the producer or his agent for the benefit of the museum. Allerton was simply doing what other museum patrons and collectors\u2014people such as Frederic Clay Bartlett, Annie Swan Coburn, Arthur Jerome Eddy, and Martin Ryerson\u2014were doing in growing the Art Institute\u2019s collection in modern and contemporary painting and sculpture, but Allerton did it with textiles. This exhibition of 33 fabrics gifted by Allerton is a tribute to his vision and highlights his little-known role in promoting the Art Institute\u2019s commitment to modern and contemporary art.",

  "title": "Van Gogh's Bedrooms",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Vincent van Gogh\u2019s bedroom in Arles is arguably the most famous chambre in the history of art. It also held special significance for the artist, who created three distinct paintings of this intimate space from 1888 to 1889. This exhibition\u2014presented only at the Art Institute of Chicago\u2014brings together all three versions of The Bedroom for the first time in North America, offering a pioneering and in-depth study of their making and meaning to Van Gogh in his relentless quest for home.\n\nVan Gogh painted his first Bedroom just after moving into his beloved \u201cYellow House\u201d in Arles, France, in 1888. He was so enamored with the work, now in the collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, that after water damage threatened its stability, he became determined to preserve the composition by painting a second version while at an asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my in 1889. Identical in scale and yet distinct from the original, that second work is now one of the icons of the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection. Van Gogh created a smaller third version, now at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris, as a gift for his mother and sister a few weeks after making the second. While the three paintings at first appear almost identical, when examined closely, each reveals distinct and unique details.\n\nThis exhibition is the first to truly delve into the fascinating history of these three paintings. Beginning with Van Gogh\u2019s early canvases of cottages and birds\u2019 nests, the show explores the artist\u2019s use of the motif of home\u2014as haven, creative chamber, and physical reality\u2014and follows the evolution of this theme throughout his career, beyond the Yellow House to the asylum at Saint-R\u00e9my. The presentation concludes with Van Gogh\u2019s final residence in Auvers-sur-Oise, where he once again painted a series of cottages\u2014returning to the idea that first evoked in him a sense of home.\n\nVan Gogh\u2019s Bedrooms features approximately 36 works by the artist, including paintings, drawings, and illustrated letters, as well as a selection of books and other ephemera known to have been in Van Gogh\u2019s possession. Enhancing the exploration of the artist\u2019s works and his longing for a place of his own are several engaging interactive presentations. A digitally enhanced reconstruction of his bedroom allows viewers the chance to experience his state of mind and the physical reality of the space that so inspired him, while other enriching digital components bring to light significant recent scientific research on the three Bedroom paintings. The result is an innovative yet intimate look at one of the most beloved and often-misunderstood artists of all time.\n\nSponsors\nLead support has been provided by the Estate of Jacquet McConville.\n\nMajor support has been generously provided by Caryn and King Harris, The Harris Family Foundation; the Gilchrist Foundation; The Morris and Dolores Kohl Kaplan Fund; and Evonne and John Yonover. \n   \nAdditional funding has been contributed by Constance and David Coolidge, the Mason Foundation, Charlene and Mark Novak, and the Comer Family Foundation. \n \nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v.S. Levy, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, Betsy Bergman Rosenfield and Andrew M. Rosenfield, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, and the Woman\u2019s Board.\n\nThe exhibition is supported by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The School of the Art Institute (SAIC) and the Art Institute of Chicago museum have long shared a symbiotic relationship\u2014one institution training artists and the other establishing an encyclopedic collection of works of art for artists and the public alike to study and enjoy. Since the Art Institute\u2019s earliest days, students have enjoyed spending class time in the galleries and have found inspiration in the museum\u2019s collection. Today, the museum is fortunate to count a great deal of works by SAIC alumni among its holdings.\nTo celebrate the long association between the museum and the school, Homegrown features approximately 120 objects, primarily works on paper, from the Art Institute\u2019s collection made by artists who attended SAIC. Beginning with the early 20th century and organized by decade, the display presents works by some of the most illustrious SAIC-educated artists while also prominently featuring pieces by those whose tenure at the school has at times been overlooked. Highlights include 20 iconic self-portraits by Ivan Albright (1897\u20131983), created at the end his career using a variety of drawing and painting media, and a selection of color woodblock prints by Gustave Baumann (1881\u20131971), a Santa Fe\u2013based artist, designer, and letterpress printer who studied at SAIC as a teenager. Also included are the sketchbooks of Margo Hoff and LeRoy Neiman; Neiman\u2019s drawings of Chicago\u2019s Oak Street Beach, in particular, showcase the glitterati of a period typified by Hugh Hefner\u2019s founding of Playboy in the city in 1953. Pieces by the so-called Monster Roster artists who matured in the late-1940s and early 1950s\u2014including Cosmo Campoli, Leon Golub, and Nancy Spero\u2014and Imagist and Hairy Who artists such as Gladys Nilsson, Suellen Rocca, Sarah Canright, and Christina Ramberg, along with a variety of more recent works, round out the selections. Nilsson\u2019s Big School Picture; Little Paper Mural, commissioned by SAIC to be used as a poster advertising the school, serves as a particularly witty, beautiful example of the artist\u2019s work in its maturity.\nThat the school has produced such a range and wealth of talented artists over the years and that the museum has been able to acquire so much of this work to share are truly causes for celebration. The Art Institute of Chicago invites you to experience and explore the best of Chicago\u2019s very own\u2014works by artists \u201chomegrown\u201d here on Michigan Avenue.",

  "title": "Martin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "One of the most renowned artists working today, Martin Puryear is celebrated for his elegant but playful sculpture and his devotion to craft. Lesser known is the extensive iterative process of drawing and printmaking that is essential to the artist\u2019s studio practice. This exhibition is the first to draw back the curtain on that practice. Featuring over 100 drawings and prints as well as 12 sculptures\u2014many borrowed directly from the artist and never displayed before\u2014the presentation offers an unprecedented look into Puryear\u2019s inspirations, methods, and transformative process.\n\nMartin Puryear has had a long relationship with Chicago and the Art Institute. He lived in the city for 12 years, \u2028and the museum has long been supportive of his work\u2014acquiring key pieces in the 1980s, organizing an extensive survey in 1991, and conserving many of his fire-damaged early prints and drawings after that show. Puryear has responded in kind, giving the museum a double-sided drawing for his sculpture Sanctuary and participating \u2028generously and closely in the development of this exhibition, including loaning many works that he has never shared publicly before.\n\nUniting these rarely seen drawings, several sculptures, and selections from his sketchbooks, Martin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions traces the artist\u2019s career from his student days at Catholic University in the early 1960s through the present, with works created as recently as 2014. Critical to Puryear\u2019s development were his formative years spent with the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone (1964\u20131966), a period in which he was inspired by and gave expression to buildings, flora, insects, animals, and children\u2014the entirety of his environment. Since then, Puryear has returned to many of these themes, experimenting with scale, materials, and varying levels of abstraction. In the exhibition, visitors can witness \u2028this evolution of thought\u2014how a sketch of a house in Sierra Leone is transformed 10 years later into an abstracted proto-sculptural form, or how a head-like shape is reworked in bronze, wood, black Cont\u00e9 crayon, and graphite.\n\nBy bringing to life the artist\u2019s uncanny ability to make forms that are suggestive, playful, and transformative, all while remaining anchored in the world, this display of Puryear\u2019s explorations across visual ideas and media offers a 360-degree view of the creative process of a contemporary master.\n\nSponsors\n\nMartin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSupport for the exhibition is provided by the Morton International Exhibition Fund and the Kemper Educational and Charitable Fund.\n\nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v.S. Levy, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, Betsy Bergman Rosenfield and Andrew M. Rosenfield, the Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, and the Woman\u2019s Board.",

  "title": "Modern Velvet: A Sense of Luxury in the Age of Industry",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "With its plush, inviting, and often-varied texture, velvet offers a sensory experience and brings to mind notions of wealth, splendor, and indulgence. For hundreds of years, this opulent textile operated as a status symbol, and today it remains a fabric with luxurious connotations. This exhibition, featuring 42 velvets from the permanent collection, examines the various effects of industry on the design and production of this splendid fabric from the 19th century to the present day, showcasing the remarkable diversity of modern velvet.\n\nDuring the Renaissance and up until the Industrial Revolution, velvet production required a great deal of time, specialized labor, and a large volume of expensive materials, especially silk and gold. Industrial innovations  in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, such as the Jacquard loom, allowed for faster production and encouraged the use of less costly materials, which made velvet available to a wider range of consumers. Despite this broader accessibility, designers and manufacturers of velvets sought to maintain the sense of luxury long associated with the textile.\n\nThe works in this exhibition demonstrate several modern approaches toward the design and production of velvet. Some of the velvets, including a colorful example designed by Gertrude Rapp in the mid-19th century,  illustrate the way in which weavers recreated the look and feel of earlier velvets through careful reproduction of historical processes. Rapp, working in Pennsylvania, established and managed a small-scale operation that produced silk as well as hand-woven velvets. Her piece in the exhibition features a lush, black pattern on a smooth plum ground enlivened through additional brightly colored patterning threads that create a  confetti-like effect. Other designs, including an early 20th-century panel by Maria Monaci Gallenga, seek to emulate the appearance of historic velvets. In Gallenga\u2019s design, however, the black velvet is made of durable cotton and printed in metallic inks, rather than woven with precious silk and gold threads. While many designers, weavers, and manufacturers, including Gallenga, explicitly borrowed from historical motifs and techniques, they also sought to embrace the potential of the new in terms of materials, design, and production methods. Swedish designer Hans Krondahl\u2019s 1965 Kyoto furnishing fabric, with a brightly colored, bold geometric pattern screen-printed onto  cotton velvet, firmly grounds itself in 20th-century design.\n\nAs these examples attest, despite\u2014and sometimes due to\u2014industrial innovations, velvet continues to  inspire designers and offer up its riches to the senses.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The Divine Art features masterpieces from the 15th through the 18th century that will cover entire walls of gallery space. Massive in scale and breathtaking in scope, these life-sized tapestries depict allegories, biblical and Christian themes, events from ancient history, and mythological scenes, as well as representations of everyday life and verdures. Included in the display are tapestries from England, Flanders, France, the Franco-Flemish region, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. A set of 14 tapestries comprises a cycle representing The Story of Caesar and Cleopatra. Often produced in multiple suites or chambers, many of the tapestries in this exhibition are connected to related pieces found in collections around the world.",
  "short_description": "For the first time in the history of the Art Institute, nearly all of its unparalleled tapestry collection is featured in a spectacular presentation. After decades in storage, these monumental artworks were subject to one of the largest tapestry conservation projects ever undertaken by a private workshop. Freshly conserved to their full splendor, The Divine Art's 70 masterpieces will only be on view for two months and then will return to storage, so be sure to catch these majestic works at their best\u2014dazzling the eye beyond expectation.",

  "title": "Master Drawings Unveiled: 25 Years of Major Acquisitions",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Chicago is renowned for its collections of master drawings both publicly and privately held. The Art Institute of Chicago has been collecting these works for over a century and has substantial world-class holdings\u2014particularly with regard to drawings of the French and Italian schools.\nThis exhibition highlights a selection of master drawings from the 17th to mid-20th century that have been purchased by the museum over the past 25 years but have not yet had occasion to be shown. Arranged chronologically, the selection opens with masterpieces of the French school dating from the 17th century through Neoclassicism. New representatives of Swiss, German, and Austrian Romanticism, midcentury Realism, and Belgian Symbolism complement other important works enhancing our already strong 19th-century group, including an early beach landscape by Edgar Degas, a haunting self-portrait by Henri Fantin-Latour, and a large preparatory drawing for the beloved Art Institute painting Paris Street; Rainy Day by Gustave Caillebotte. The survey culminates with images from the first half of the 20th century, among them the momentous pastel January by Grant Wood, creator of another Art Institute icon, American Gothic.\nThe Art Institute received its first major gift of drawings\u2014almost 4,000 European and American works from Walter Gurley in memory of his mother, Leonora Hall Gurley\u2014nearly 100 years ago in 1922. In 1940, the museum brought on its first professional curator dedicated to the medium, Carl O. Schniewind, and began an ambitious program to acquire signal works of drawings. Ongoing curatorial commitment was demonstrated in a 1991 show of the Art Institute\u2019s then-recent drawing acquisitions at the Frick Collection in New York. Twenty-five years later, this presentation offers the chance to experience the debut of these major works in the Art Institute galleries and appreciate how they enrich the museum\u2019s esteemed and wide-ranging collection.",

  "description": "This exhibition included over sixty textiles selected from the museum\u2019s permanent collection; they were primarily produced and manufactured in England and France between the 1770s and 1830s. During this period, a far larger segment of the population had access to these fabrics because the natural-colored, plain-woven cloth available for them was less expensive than the silk and velvet fabrics used in past centuries. Pieces such as the ones exhibited were used as fabrics for bed hangings, upholstery, wall coverings, and window curtains. The textiles in the exhibition were further supplemented with original engravings in books and independently issued prints used in the creation of such works. This exhibition was a sequel to \u201cEnglish and French Printed Textiles\u2014History on Cloth,\u201d which took place from May 1 to August 11, 1991.",

  "title": "Whistler's Mother: An American Icon Returns to Chicago",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In 1878, James McNeill Whistler said about his most famous painting, Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1 (Portrait of the Artist\u2019s Mother), \u201cTake the picture of my mother, exhibited at the Royal Academy as an \u2018Arrangement in Grey and Black.\u2019 Now that is what it is. To me it is interesting as a picture of my mother; but what can or ought the public to care about the identity of the portrait?\u201d Painted in 1871, the portrait was intended to demonstrate Whistler\u2019s recent focus on tonal harmonies over subject matter. \n\nBoth austere and ambitious, accurate and abstract, the portrait serves as a quintessential expression of his then-newly developed \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d aesthetic. The composition\u2014better known today as \u201cWhistler\u2019s Mother\u201d\u2014was initially met with puzzlement, but it was soon lauded, spurring a staggering quantity of critical responses, reproductions in various media, and references within popular culture. Despite Whistler\u2019s intentions, the portrait of Anna McNeill Whistler has thus become an icon of motherhood, beloved by Americans but rarely seen in the United States.\n\nIn March, Whistler\u2019s masterpiece returns to Chicago for the first time in over 60 years. The fame of this iconic work is considered in a focused installation of approximately 25 objects, including small- and large-format paintings, prints, drawings, posters, and other ephemera. The presentation also explores Whistler\u2019s use of family members as subjects, his abstract treatment of conventional genres such as portraiture and landscape, and the arc of his professional ambition.\n\nThe return of \u201cWhistler\u2019s Mother\u201d to the Art Institute of Chicago is especially meaningful given the museum\u2019s deep holdings of Whistler\u2019s paintings, prints, and drawings. Championed by the museum during his lifetime, Whistler is one of the 19th-century artists whose work lies at the core of the Art Institute\u2019s collection.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Presented as a companion to the major exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity, which investigates Impressionist artists\u2019 expressive use of contemporary fashion in depictions of public life, this exhibition focuses on the private side of apparel\u2014and the lack thereof. Featuring more than 120 drawings and prints, as well as select paintings, photographs, and materials from the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries, Undressed explores the connotations of informal dress and undress in intimate, personal situations. These images, ranging from the late 18th to the mid-20th century and from continental Europe to the United States, offer a rare glimpse of the inner life of private individuals.\nDisplayed in the Jean and Steven Goldman Prints and Drawings Galleries in the Richard and Mary L. Gray Wing, the exhibition comprises various themes\u2014artist and model, bathers, the domestic sphere, mother and child, romantic (and illicit) relationships, tragedy, and prostitution. The presentation opens with a hallmark theme of 19th-century art: women bathing and grooming themselves. Edgar Degas\u2019s rarely seen pastel Woman at her Toilette is a highlight of this section. Additional works on paper by Mary Cassatt, \u00c9douard Manet, and Pierre Bonnard, as well as The Tub, a sculpture by Degas, illustrate the popularity of the subject across media. Works by Paul C\u00e9zanne and Edvard Munch depict recreational male bathers, while those of Honor\u00e9 Victorin Daumier inject humor into the theme.\nSeveral galleries concentrate on private domestic moments, with explorations of such activities as dressing, sleeping, and reading; Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s Elles portfolio is of particular note, offering a glimpse into an interior world of women. Daumier\u2019s comedic representation of bourgeois grooming is complemented by earlier British caricatures, and tender maternal scenes occupy an entire gallery, highlighted by the beloved works of Cassatt.\nThe drawing Model Reading in the Studio by Gustave Courbet anchors a gallery devoted to artists\u2019 academic depictions of the nude or partially undressed model. Other galleries focus on the darker side of undress\u2014prostitution, murder, and death scenes demonstrate the devastatingly vulnerable nature of nakedness.\nTogether these exceptional\u2014and often rarely seen\u2014works offer an alluring, tender, terrifying, and altogether behind-the-scenes perspective on dress and undress, the fascinating flip side of the very public face of high fashion.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In 1997, 26 tightly wrapped brown paper parcels were discovered deep in a storage area for the Department of Prints and Drawings. Their presence was a mystery, their contents a puzzle. As conservators and curators carefully worked to open the envelopes, they were surprised and intrigued to find that they contained 50-year-old monumental posters created by TASS, the Soviet Union\u2019s news agency. The idea for a major exhibition began to take shape.\nImpressively large\u2014between five and ten feet tall\u2014and striking in the vibrancy and texture of the stencil medium\u2014some demanded 60 to 70 different stencils and color divisions\u2014these posters were originally sent abroad, including to the Art Institute, to serve as international cultural \u201cambassadors\u201d and to rally allied and neutral nations to the endeavors of the Soviet Union, a partner of the United States and Great Britain in the fight against Nazi Germany. In Windows on the War, the posters will be presented both as unique historical objects and as works of art that demonstrate how the preeminent artists of the day used unconventional technical and aesthetic means to contribute to the fight against the Nazis, marking a major chapter in the history of design and propaganda.\nFor most of the 20th century, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union hovered between uneasy alliance and outright hostility. The period addressed by this exhibition\u2014the years 1941\u201345\u2014represents a fleeting moment when the nations were joined in a purposeful bond, a coalition attested to repeatedly in the posters of the TASS studio. This spirit of cooperation was short-lived, however; as early as 1945, an \u201ciron curtain\u201d began to descend between East and West, the seeds of which had been stealthily germinating throughout the war years. By the end of 1946, it was clear that the wartime alliance against Fascism would be supplanted by old allegiances and enemies in a budding \u201ccold\u201d war. Likewise, images of camaraderie from the World War II era were quickly buried, and iconographies of fear and suspicion, with their roots in the prewar decades, reemerged.\nWindows on the War features 250 posters from the war and pre-war period, 155 of which are the large-scale stenciled posters produced at the TASS studio. Viewers will also find their rich historical and cultural context revealed through photographs and documentary material illuminating the visual culture of US\u2013USSR relations before and during the war.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The Art Institute\u2019s Department of Textiles is fortunate to own a large collection, some 200 in all, of kesa, the rectangular or trapezoidal outer garment traditionally worn by Buddhist monks and priests in Japan. The textiles have been mostly acquired over the years by donations from various private collectors, but the largest group and many of the most significant pieces came from the collection of Ralph and Mary Hays in 2004. Although a few examples of our kesa have been displayed in the past, this is the first exhibition at the Art Institute to present an overview of this distinctive group of textiles.\n\nOften described as a mantle or robe, the kesa is worn draped diagonally over the left shoulder and under the right armpit. The Japanese term kesa derives from the Sanskrit word kasaya (or turbulence, an allusion to the dyeing process) and indicates the garment\u2019s Indian origin. Indeed, as a reminder of this origin and the historical Buddha\u2019s own simple patched garment, kesa are formed from many fragments of the same cloth. Within each garment, the fragments are typically organized in a series of columns framed by a border with mitered corners. The number of columns, ranging from five to 25 but most often seven, indicates both the specific function of that garment and also the rank of the wearer within the religious hierarchy. Many examples are adorned with six added squares, usually from a different fabric, that reinforced points of stress from wear but have assumed symbolic value as well. Attached rings, loops, and cords helped hold the garments in place when worn.\n\nAlthough there are earlier examples, particularly in Japanese temple collections, most surviving kesa date from the Edo period (1615\u20131868) and the Meiji period (1868\u20131912). The fabrics used during these periods are often highly patterned and made of sumptuous materials, in aristocratic defiance of the garments\u2019 humble beginnings. Some of the fabrics are reused garments\u2014Noh theatrical robes, kimonos, even Chinese robes\u2014donated to temples by wealthy devotees. This selection of 23 kesa shows both the range and exquisite intricacy of this beautiful and historically rich garment.",

  "title": "Poetry of Friendship: Surimono and the Cultural Salons of Japan",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "The type of surimono featured in this exhibition represent an important and neglected type of Japanese woodblock print. Known for their large size, often prodigious amount of text, and intricate relationship between word and images, the earliest surimono were created in the first decades of the eighteenth century, and the last in the mid-twentieth century. The many characters seen in surimono are mostly composed of haiku poetry. These short, concise poems, usually incorporate seasonal symbols and nature images, are part of a poetic tradition that has remained popular in Japan for centuries.\n\nThese prints are communal in nature; the poems were often created by groups of men and women, who included actors, geisha, artists, intellectuals, and entertainers, who gathered in cultural groups or salons in order to converse, drink wine, and compose poetry. They regularly met in order to mark certain occasions in the life of the groups, such as weddings, name changes, retirements, death anniversaries, and New Year celebrations. On the prints commissioned by the group for such occasions, poems were carefully placed in a proscribed order of importance and then matched with images that again carefully reflected the special occasion, the season, and the content of the accompanying poems.",

  "title": "Along the Lines: Selected Drawings by Saul Steinberg",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Saul Steinberg (American, born Romania, 1914\u201399) had one of the most remarkable and varied careers in postwar American art. While known for the drawings that graced the cover of the New Yorker for nearly six decades, he was equally acclaimed for the drawings, paintings, prints, collages, and sculptures he exhibited in galleries and museums throughout the world. Through these parallel careers\u2014cartoonist and independent artist\u2014Steinberg crafted a rich and ever-evolving idiom and, in the process, became celebrated the world over for giving graphic definition to the postwar age.\nSteinberg defined drawing as \u201ca way of reasoning on paper,\u201d and he remained committed to the act of drawing in an era dominated by large-scale painting and sculpture. Throughout his long career, he used drawing to think about the semantics of art, reconfiguring stylistic signs into a new language suited to modern life. He was, as the title of one of his books puts it, the \u201cinspector,\u201d seeing through every false front, every pretense. Sometimes with affection, sometimes with irony, but always with virtuoso mastery, Steinberg peeled back the carefully wrought masks of 20th-century civilization.\nHis heritage as a Romanian Jew\u2014who experienced firsthand that country\u2019s often virulent anti-Semitism as well as the rise of anti-Semitic laws in a previously cosmopolitan and tolerant Italy\u2014pervaded his take on all things American. Naturally curious, Steinberg was especially interested in how Americans behaved, how they surrounded themselves with luxuries and participated in leisure activities, sometimes without much awareness of the suffering experienced around the world, or even in their own country. The banalities and ubiquities of American culture were frequent subjects of his drawings, themes in which he delighted and from which he kept ironic distance. His work also addressed philosophical questions, still lifes, Hollywood, and identity through masks.\nFeaturing 54 drawings generously gifted by the Saul Steinberg Foundation in 2013, this exhibition offers a comprehensive survey of the artist\u2019s diverse output. Whether created to stand on their own, for reproduction, or for commercial uses, the drawings in this show afford a new appreciation of Steinberg and his remarkably playful, inventive, and insightful art.",

  "description": "his fall, the Art Institute of Chicago offers a glimpse into one of the world\u2019s most intimate religious traditions. Bringing together over 100 artworks from private and public collections in India and the United States, Gates of the Lord: The Tradition of Krishna Paintings is the first major U.S. exhibition to explore the unique visual culture of the Pushtimarg, a Hindu denomination from Western India.\nFounded in the 16th century by the saint and philosopher Shri Vallabhacharya (1479\u20131531), the Pushtimarg is a religious community dedicated to the devotion of Shrinathji, a divine image of the Hindu god Krishna as a seven-year-old child. The religious and artistic center of the sect is based in the temple town of Nathdwara (literally, \u201cThe Gates of the Lord\u201d), near Udaipur in the state of Rajasthan, India. Scholars and artists have long been fascinated by the distinctive and highly aestheticized manner in which members of this group venerate Shrinathji, as well as by the legacy of miniature paintings created as a record of such worship. This exhibition showcases centuries of pichvais (textile hangings) and miniature paintings that have been created by and for the Pushtimarg in devotion of Shrinathji.\n\nThe exhibition takes visitors through a year in Nathdwara, where the daily worship of Shrinathji is characterized by the changing seasons and a bustling festival calendar. Gallery by gallery, visitors are introduced to the pichvais used as backdrops for Shrinathji in his shrine, each uniquely suited to a particular season or festival. The accompanying miniature paintings offer further insight into the Pushtimarg sect: its mode of veneration, history, and important priests and patron families. Enhancing the experience of the sect\u2019s rich culture are festival and devotional music, a shrine reconstruction, and touchscreen kiosks that allow visitors to page through religious manuscripts, an artist\u2019s sketchbook, and a historic photo album. The exhibition concludes with an exploration of the works, sketches, and observations of prominent 20th- and 21st-century Nathdwara artists who have kept the painting tradition flourishing through the present day.\n\nGates of the Lord comprises drawings, pichvais, paintings, and historic photographs borrowed chiefly from two major private collections in India, the renowned TAPI Collection of Praful and Shilpa Shah (Surat, India) and the Amit Ambalal Collection (Ahmedabad, India). These rare loans are augmented by important objects from a number of public and private collections within the United States, including the Art Institute\u2019s own permanent collection, in order to present the richest possible story of Pushtimarg art and tradition.\n\nSponsors\nLead Sponsorship for Gates of the Lord: The Tradition of Krishna Paintings has been provided by Nita and Mukesh Ambani and the Reliance Foundation.\nMajor funding has been generously contributed by Anita and Prabhakant Sinha.\n\nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v. S. Levy, Thomas and Margot Pritzker, \nthe Earl and Brenda Shapiro Foundation, and the Woman\u2019s Board.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Featuring over 45 bedcovers, coverlets, needlework, printed handkerchiefs, and other household textiles from the permanent collection of the Department of Textiles, this exhibition explored the evolution of an American textile tradition as home creation, cottage industry, and commercial production developed between the years 1776 and 1840. While some needlework and textiles during this period were born out of necessity, others evoke refinement and sophistication, reflecting the overall growth, ingenuity, and prosperity of a new nation.\n\nTraditionally textiles, whether made in the home or commercially, were considered prized possessions, but their value was not merely monetary; they often held special significance for the makers and their descendants. Many such textiles bear the maker\u2019s name, and as treasured heirlooms were passed from one generation to the next serving as family record.\n\nThe sewing of textiles was also vital to the maintenance of a household. This important female skill not only provided the necessities of clothing and bedding but also a socially acceptable activity for women. The sewn and embroidered textiles in this exhibition represent the work of schoolgirls and women who had the means and time to pursue the needle arts. The works\u2019 highly skilled execution and complex designs are evidence of the artistic and personal expression they provided.\n\nA bridge from home to commercial production can be seen in the exhibition\u2019s woven coverlets. Coverlet weavers in homes and separate workshops formed a cottage industry that would eventually grow into a full-scale commercial business by the mid-19th century. Printed textiles, on the other hand, were a product of the innovations and technological advancements of the Industrial Revolution, part of the commercial manufacturing industry that disseminated affordable textiles to a wider audience. With the mechanization of production and printing, textiles were able to keep pace with fashion and current events.\n\nWhether sewn, woven, or printed, the textiles in this exhibition trace the development of an American textile tradition\u2014one in which industrialization played a dominant role transforming raw materials into finished products but one that was also impacted by changes in the American home from creation out of necessity to a burgeoning consumer economy. Within these diverse textiles and their development, one can witness the innovation and progress of an early but thriving new United States.",

  "description": "Overview\nThe exhibition Taoism and the Arts of China is on view at The Art Institute of Chicago from November 4, 2000, to January 7, 2001, and at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco from February 21 to May 13, 2001. This is the first major exhibition of Taoist art in the United States, showcasing 151 works of art illustrating many facets of the Taoist religion. The exhibition includes paintings, calligraphy, sculpture, porcelain, lacquer, and ritual robes and implements from museums and private collections in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. These items date from the Warring States period to the Qing dynasty and demonstrate the development of Taoism and Taoist art from its earliest precedents to its \"renaissance\" in the late imperial age.\n\nAdmission to the exhibition is free with museum admission. The Art Institute will publish a catalogue of the exhibition, with essays by prominent scholars of Taoism and Chinese art history, and sponsor a symposium in the museum's Rubloff Auditorium on December 2 and 3, 2000. There will also be public lectures and other educational events relating to Taoism during the run of the exhibition. Families visiting the exhibition with children should pick up the free Family Self-Guide at the exhibition entrance or download it as a .pdf file. You will need Adobe Acrobat Reader to read and print the document. This site provides an overview of the exhibition using 28 works that address the themes of Taoism and the Arts of China.",

  "description": "After seeing Theodore Roussel\u2019s watercolor The Thames Embankment, Chelsea at a London gallery in 1885, the already well-established James McNeill Whistler requested an introduction to the younger artist. Their meeting sparked more than a decade of professional collaboration that included side-by-side working sessions and camaraderie in both public and private settings. As a result of this communal creativity, Whistler, Roussel, and their artistic circle made remarkable technical and aesthetic developments in lithography and color etching. This exhibition\u2014built around the Art Institute\u2019s exceptional holdings of works on paper by Whistler and a recent major gift of works by Roussel\u2014offers a new perspective on this artistic network and the resulting innovation through 175 objects, including etchings, lithographs, drawings, paintings, and artist-designed frames.\nThe exhibition demonstrates the creative impact of the group\u2019s shared network of models, studio assistants, poets, and critics. Related works by various members of this network\u2014from the museum\u2019s permanent collection as well as private collections and the Terra Foundation for American Art\u2014are enhanced and given context by the inclusion of correspondence, historical ephemera, and surviving etching plates, presenting a full picture of the creative exchange and invention that characterized this 19th-century artistic community.\nAccompanying the exhibition is an interactive digital component, available both in the galleries and also on the Art Institute\u2019s website, which gives visitors the opportunity to explore the extent of interconnection among the members of Whistler and Roussel\u2019s network. Each artist is represented by a portrait image, a brief biography, and a list of related works, while different layers of the interface illustrate how various members of the network were connected through professional, familial, or other social relationships. A digital publication\u2014aimed at Whistler enthusiasts, students of 19th-century art, and those more broadly interested in the history of artistic collaboration\u2014provides additional insight into the exhibition.\nWhistler and Roussel: Linked Visions and its related digital offerings are supported by the Lunder Foundation.",

  "title": "The Thrill of the Chase: The Harry B. and Bessie K. Braude Memorial Collection",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "This past summer, Boston collector Dorothy Braude Edinburg presented the Art Institute with an extraordinary gift of more than 600 prints, 190 drawings, 150 Chinese and Korean ceramics, and her collection of Japanese illustrated books. Given in memory of her parents, Harry B. and Bessie K. Braude, who instilled in her artistic interests and high standards, these remarkable works are a landmark gift\u2014not only for the museum but for all of Chicago. For the past 22 years, Edinburg has worked in active partnership with Art Institute curators both to bring the city the great works she has gathered throughout her life and to target and acquire new works for the museum\u2019s collection.\nThis exhibition features 97 drawings purchased by Edinburg for the museum since 1991, a treasure trove of works on paper from the 16th through the mid-20th century. Among the early Italian, French, and Spanish pieces is a rare, moving wash drawing, Sleeping Christ Child, by the popular Baroque artist Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo. A highlight of the early Northern schools, one of Edinburg\u2019s special interests, is Jacob Jordaens\u2019s eloquent Jacob and Esau. Works by Constable and Karl Friedrich Schinkel crown the assortment of British and German 19th-century works, while the 19th-century French collection boasts rich representation of Paul C\u00e9zanne, Edgar Degas, and Claude Monet. And finally the 20th-century masters on view include Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, Giorgio Morandi, Jean Metzinger, Pablo Picasso, and several German Expressionists. Chosen with Edinburg\u2019s unrelenting standards of condition, research, and scholarship, these drawings both effectively represent the essence of an artist\u2019s achievement and stand as significant, independent statements.\nSpeaking of her decades-long experience working with curators from the Department of Prints and Drawings, Edinburg remarked, \u201cWe have had tremendous fun together, enjoying the thrill of the chase and the entire process of determining the authenticity, condition, attribution, and importance of a drawing.\u201d That department\u2014and many others across the museum\u2014have enjoyed this rich relationship as well; not only has Edinburg greatly enhanced many collections but she has invigorated the museum with her acquisitive passion and enthusiastic spirit. With this most recent gift, intended as a public resource to inspire others, Chicago too shall be forever transformed by Edinburg\u2019s keen eye and great generosity.",

  "title": "Everyone's Art Gallery: Posters of the London Underground",
  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "In 1919, 39 posters came to the Art Institute of Chicago, courtesy of the Underground Electric Railways London. The posters, full of brilliant colors and innovative designs, were part of an effort to encourage Londoners to use this commercial transportation system: to visit the city\u2019s cultural attractions, go shopping, attend sporting events, and even venture into the countryside\u2014all by taking Underground trains and buses, of course. Installed outside Underground stations on public streets and on the front of buses that traversed the city, these posters formed a vibrant civic art presence\u2014a public gallery available to all.  \n\nOver the next 20 years more posters arrived at the museum, coming at irregular intervals and eventually forming a collection of almost 350 artworks\u2014an extraordinary sample from the golden age of this remarkable poster campaign, one that continues to this day. Until now, however, the story of how and why these posters came to Chicago has not been known. The architect of the poster campaign, from its inception in 1908 until 1939, was Frank Pick, an executive with London\u2019s Underground. Pick's enthusiasm for art education led him to commission poster designs from many young artists. Indeed, it is likely that the close relationship between the Art Institute of Chicago and the School of the Art Institute was one reason that Pick chose the museum as the eventual keeper of this poster archive. \n\nThis exhibition, the first at the museum to showcase this unique collection, begins with a chronological sampling of the posters. Thematic sections feature popular subjects, such as the zoo, museums, and Hampton Court, the royal palace southwest of London on the Thames, while focused displays are devoted to three of the greatest artists who worked for the Underground: Charles Paine, Frederick Herrick, and one of the most illustrious poster artists of the 20th century, Edward McKnight Kauffer, who studied briefly at the School of the Art Institute on his way to Europe.\n\nAmong the show\u2019s highlights is Charles Paine's clever take on King Henry the VIII, depicting him with large shears trimming the heads off his topiary queens in Hampton Court by Tram (1922). Others include Mary Koop's Summer Sales (1925), which invites viewers to follow a riot of brightly colored umbrellas toward their shopping destination; a modernist depiction of time by Clive Gardiner from 1928 urging riders to buy a season Underground ticket; and Harold Sandys Williamson\u2019s Cheap Tickets to Town, Shop between 10 and 4 (1939), an almost surrealistic view of the London cityscape, its sky a sea of floating barrage balloons as protection from German bombs.\n\nA century after the initial posters arrived at the museum, this exhibition features 100 posters\u2014a celebration of the gift, Frank Pick\u2019s inventive campaign, and the beautiful artworks it produced.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "Newspapers, magazines, and websites frequently offer lists: the 10 best new restaurants, the 50 top places to see in the world, the 100 best movies of all time. Chicago-based artist Cauleen Smith (American, born 1967) has created another kind of list, a new canon of humanistic literacy presented as a series of drawings. Titled Human_3.0 Reading List, the project represents a new dimension of Smith\u2019s work, one that engages with the idea of a collective consciousness through manually drawn renderings of book covers.\nIn this series of 57 drawings\u2014each produced on 8\u00bd \u00d7 12- inch graph paper in watercolor over graphite, occasionally elaborated with acrylic\u2014the artist proposes a selection of books that is both personal, conveyed by the frequent inclusion of fingers or a thumb shown holding up a given book, and idiosyncratic. Harriet Tubman, C. L. R. James, and bell hooks find their place alongside Starfish, Sea Urchins, and Their Kin by Nelson Herwig. Together the drawings ask challenging questions: Have you read these books? Will you read these books? What will they mean to you? What do they mean to us now? Which titles might be missing?\nAn artist whose primary discipline is film, Smith has incorporated various influences and references in her images\u2014science fiction, the black diaspora, and the lyrical potential of landscape. She first garnered national recognition with her feature-length film Drylongso (1998), which she completed during her graduate training at UCLA\u2019s film school. In 2010, Smith moved to Chicago, where her work has grown increasingly site-specific and engaged in social activism. She created the Solar Flare Arkestral Marching Band Project, which has organized flash-mob appearances of a marching band composed of youth groups from the city\u2019s South Side. This and other recent works have explicitly invoked the legacy of pioneering composer and performer Sun Ra, whose music and elaborate self-defining mythology also propelled the broader artistic movement of Afrofuturism.\nGrounded in a sober assessment of race relations and institutional power structures, Human_3.0 Reading List calls its viewers to prepare for social change through self-empowered education. In the final words of the manifesto accompanying the series, Smith exhorts her audience: \u201cLove. Resist. Read on. Right on.\u201d\nSponsors\nSupport for this exhibition is provided by the Print and Drawing Club of the Art Institute of Chicago.",

  "is_featured": false,
  "description": "celandic artist and musician Ragnar Kjartansson\u2019s often intensely durational performance-based works manifest a rare synthesis of pathos and humor. A Lot of Sorrow is both a music video and an extended concert film, in which Brooklyn-based band the National performs its three-and-a-half minute ballad \u201cSorrow\u201d on repeat for six hours. The band\u2019s music and lyrics frequently conjure notions of romantic suffering and melancholy\u2014themes common to Kjartansson\u2019s emotive, theatrical work.\n\nAs the hours pass and fatigue sets in, the musicians subtly alter their song; the original track is always recognizable but is also shown to be elastic and expressive rather than rigid. Kjartansson is sometimes visible in the role of roadie, offering water and food to the performers throughout the concert. Multiple camera angles grant the viewer access to both the perspective of the musicians and that of the audience, as the band and the crowd feed off each other\u2019s energy with every repetition.",

  "description": "This landmark exhibition is devoted to the marine paintings of Edouard Manet (1832\u20131883), a little-studied but highly significant aspect of the career of the artist who is sometimes referred to as the father of Impressionism.\n\nTaking Manet\u2019s seascapes\u2014ranging from 1864 to shortly before his death in 1883\u2014as a point of departure, the exhibition traces the complex interactions that link the artist to his immediate predecessors and contemporaries, including Gustave Courbet, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, and James McNeill Whistler, among others.\n\nManet and the Sea brings together innovative works on sea-related themes by a variety of artists with differing ambitions. At the same time, it addresses emergent sociohistorical phenomena, especially the increase of tourism, which made the sea newly attractive to artists in the second half of the 19th century.",
